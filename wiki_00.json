The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called \"numerals\"; for example, \"5\" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a \"numeral\" is not clearly distinguished from the \"number\" that it represents.\nIn mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include zero (0), negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half formula_1, real numbers such as the square root of 2 formula_2 and , and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.\nBesides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and \"a million\" may signify \"a lot\" rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.\nDuring the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems are considered important special examples of more general algebraic structures such as rings and fields, and the application of the term \"number\" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.\nHistory.\nNumerals.\nNumbers should be distinguished from numerals, the symbols used to represent numbers. The Egyptians invented the first ciphered numeral system, and the Greeks followed by mapping their counting numbers onto Ionian and Doric alphabets. Roman numerals, a system that used combinations of letters from the Roman alphabet, remained dominant in Europe until the spread of the superior Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system around the late 14th century, and the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system remains the most common system for representing numbers in the world today. The key to the effectiveness of the system was the symbol for zero, which was developed by ancient Indian mathematicians around 500 AD. \nFirst use of numbers.\nBones and other artifacts have been discovered with marks cut into them that many believe are tally marks. These tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed time, such as numbers of days, lunar cycles or keeping records of quantities, such as of animals.\nA tallying system has no concept of place value (as in modern decimal notation), which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless, tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.\nThe first known system with place value was the Mesopotamian base\u00a060 system (\u00a0BC) and the earliest known base\u00a010 system dates to 3100\u00a0BC in Egypt.\nZero.\nThe first known documented use of zero dates to AD 628, and appeared in the \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\", the main work of the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta. He treated\u00a00 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including division. By this time (the 7th\u00a0century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as Khmer numerals, and documentation shows the idea later spreading to China and the Islamic world.\nBrahmagupta's \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\" is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as \"zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number.\" The \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\" is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.\nThe use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in place-value systems. Many ancient texts used\u00a00. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word \"nfr\" to denote zero\u00a0balance in double entry accounting. Indian texts used a Sanskrit word or to refer to the concept of \"void\". In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero. In a similar vein, P\u0101\u1e47ini (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the \"Ashtadhyayi\", an early example of an algebraic grammar for the Sanskrit language (also see Pingala).\nThere are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\".\nRecords show that the Ancient Greeks seemed unsure about the status of\u00a00 as a number: they asked themselves \"how can 'nothing' be something?\" leading to interesting philosophical and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of\u00a00 and the vacuum. The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of\u00a00. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether\u00a0 was a number.)\nThe late Olmec people of south-central Mexico began to use a symbol for zero, a shell glyph, in the New World, possibly by the but certainly by 40\u00a0BC, which became an integral part of Maya numerals and the Maya calendar. Maya arithmetic used base\u00a04 and base\u00a05 written as base\u00a020. George I. S\u00e1nchez in 1961 reported a base\u00a04, base\u00a05 \"finger\" abacus.\nBy 130 AD, Ptolemy, influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for\u00a00 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic Greek numerals. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this Hellenistic zero was the first \"documented\" use of a true zero in the Old World. In later Byzantine manuscripts of his \"Syntaxis Mathematica\" (\"Almagest\"), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the Greek letter Omicron (otherwise meaning\u00a070).\nAnother true zero was used in tables alongside Roman numerals by 525 (first known use by Dionysius Exiguus), but as a word, meaning \"nothing\", not as a symbol. When division produced\u00a00 as a remainder, , also meaning \"nothing\", was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval computists (calculators of Easter). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by Bede or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.\nNegative numbers.\nThe abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100\u201350 BC in China. \"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\" contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive coefficients, black for negative. The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd\u00a0century AD in Greece. Diophantus referred to the equation equivalent to (the solution is negative) in \"Arithmetica\", saying that the equation gave an absurd result.\nDuring the 600s, negative numbers were in use in India to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, in \"Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\" in 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form quadratic formula that remains in use today. However, in the 12th\u00a0century in India, Bhaskara gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value \"is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots\".\nEuropean mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th\u00a0century, although Fibonacci allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter\u00a013 of \"Liber Abaci\", 1202) and later as losses (in ). Ren\u00e9 Descartes called them false roots as they cropped up in algebraic polynomials yet he found a way to swap true roots and false roots as well. At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral. The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by Nicolas Chuquet during the 15th\u00a0century. He used them as exponents, but referred to them as \"absurd numbers\".\nAs recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless.\nRational numbers.\nIt is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to prehistoric times. The Ancient Egyptians used their Egyptian fraction notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of number theory. The best known of these is Euclid's \"Elements\", dating to roughly 300\u00a0BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the Sthananga Sutra, which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.\nThe concept of decimal fractions is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to pi or the square root of 2. Similarly, Babylonian math texts used sexagesimal (base\u00a060) fractions with great frequency.\nIrrational numbers.\nThe earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the Indian Sulba Sutras composed between 800 and 500\u00a0BC. The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to Pythagoras, more specifically to the Pythagorean Hippasus of Metapontum, who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.\nThe 16th century brought final European acceptance of negative integral and fractional numbers. By the 17th\u00a0 century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook the scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since Euclid. In 1872, the publication of the theories of Karl Weierstrass (by his pupil E. Kossak), Eduard Heine, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind was brought about. In 1869, Charles M\u00e9ray had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by Salvatore Pincherle (1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by Paul Tannery (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of real numbers, separating all rational numbers into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, Kronecker, and M\u00e9ray.\nThe search for roots of quintic and higher degree equations was an important development, the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem (Ruffini 1799, Abel 1824) showed that they could not be solved by radicals (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of algebraic numbers (all solutions to polynomial equations). Galois (1832) linked polynomial equations to group theory giving rise to the field of Galois theory.\nContinued fractions, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of Euler, and at the opening of the 19th\u00a0century were brought into prominence through the writings of Joseph Louis Lagrange. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenm\u00fcller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and G\u00fcnther (1872). Ramus first connected the subject with determinants, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, M\u00f6bius, and G\u00fcnther, in the theory of .\nTranscendental numbers and reals.\nThe existence of transcendental numbers was first established by Liouville (1844, 1851). Hermite proved in 1873 that \"e\" is transcendental and Lindemann proved in 1882 that \u03c0 is transcendental. Finally, Cantor showed that the set of all real numbers is uncountably infinite but the set of all algebraic numbers is countably infinite, so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.\nInfinity and infinitesimals.\nThe earliest known conception of mathematical infinity appears in the Yajur Veda, an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, \"If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity.\" Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the Jain mathematicians c. 400\u00a0BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually. The symbol formula_3 is often used to represent an infinite quantity.\nAristotle defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between actual infinity and potential infinity\u2014the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. Galileo Galilei's \"Two New Sciences\" discussed the idea of one-to-one correspondences between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by Georg Cantor; in 1895 he published a book about his new set theory, introducing, among other things, transfinite numbers and formulating the continuum hypothesis.\nIn the 1960s, Abraham Robinson showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of hyperreal numbers represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about infinite and infinitesimal numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz.\nA modern geometrical version of infinity is given by projective geometry, which introduces \"ideal points at infinity\", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in perspective drawing.\nComplex numbers.\nThe earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor Heron of Alexandria in the , when he considered the volume of an impossible frustum of a pyramid. They became more prominent when in the 16th\u00a0century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia and Gerolamo Cardano. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.\nThis was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When Ren\u00e9 Descartes coined the term \"imaginary\" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See imaginary number for a discussion of the \"reality\" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation\nseemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity\nwhich is valid for positive real numbers \"a\" and \"b\", and was also used in complex number calculations with one of \"a\", \"b\" positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity\nin the case when both \"a\" and \"b\" are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol \"i\" in place of formula_7 to guard against this mistake.\nThe 18th century saw the work of Abraham de Moivre and Leonhard Euler. De Moivre's formula (1730) states:\nwhile Euler's formula of complex analysis (1748) gave us:\nThe existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until Caspar Wessel described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. Carl Friedrich Gauss rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in Wallis's \"De algebra tractatus\".\nAlso in 1799, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Niels Henrik Abel, and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success that is well known.\nGauss studied complex numbers of the form , where \"a\" and \"b\" are integral, or rational (and \"i\" is one of the two roots of ). His student, Gotthold Eisenstein, studied the type , where \"\u03c9\" is a complex root of Other such classes (called cyclotomic fields) of complex numbers derive from the roots of unity for higher values of \"k\". This generalization is largely due to Ernst Kummer, who also invented ideal numbers, which were expressed as geometrical entities by Felix Klein in 1893.\nIn 1850 Victor Alexandre Puiseux took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of essential singular points. This eventually led to the concept of the extended complex plane.\nPrime numbers.\nPrime numbers have been studied throughout recorded history. Euclid devoted one book of the \"Elements\" to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and presented the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\nIn 240 BC, Eratosthenes used the Sieve of Eratosthenes to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the Renaissance and later eras.\nIn 1796, Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured the prime number theorem, describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the Goldbach conjecture, which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the Riemann hypothesis, formulated by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. The prime number theorem was finally proved by Jacques Hadamard and Charles de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.\nMain classification.\nNumbers can be classified into sets, called number sets or number systems, such as the natural numbers and the real numbers. The main number systems are as follows:\nEach of these number system is a subset of the next one. So, for example, a rational number is also a real number, and every real number is also a complex number. This can be expressed symbolically as\nA more complete list of number sets appears in the following diagram.\nNatural numbers.\nThe most familiar numbers are the natural numbers (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with\u00a01 (0 was not even considered a number for the Ancient Greeks.) However, in the 19th\u00a0century, set theorists and other mathematicians started including\u00a00 (cardinality of the empty set, i.e. 0\u00a0elements, where\u00a00 is thus the smallest cardinal number) in the set of natural numbers. Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including\u00a00 or not. The mathematical symbol for the set of all natural numbers is N, also written formula_11, and sometimes formula_12 or formula_13 when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.\nIn the base 10 numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base\u00a010 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a place value of\u00a01, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.\nIn set theory, which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics, natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number\u00a03 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in Peano Arithmetic, the number\u00a03 is represented as sss0, where s is the \"successor\" function (i.e.,\u00a03 is the third successor of\u00a00). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent\u00a03 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.\nIntegers.\nThe negative of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces\u00a00 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a minus sign). As an example, the negative of\u00a07 is written\u00a0\u22127, and . When the set of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including\u00a00), the result is defined as the set of integers, Z also written formula_14. Here the letter Z comes . The set of integers forms a ring with the operations addition and multiplication.\nThe natural numbers form a subset of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as positive integers, and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as non-negative integers.\nRational numbers.\nA rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction represents \"m\" parts of a whole divided into \"n\" equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example and are equal, that is:\nIn general,\nIf the absolute value of \"m\" is greater than \"n\" (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than\u00a01. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to\u00a01 and can also be positive, negative, or\u00a00. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator\u00a01. For example\u00a0\u22127 can be written\u00a0. The symbol for the rational numbers is Q (for \"quotient\"), also written formula_18.\nReal numbers.\nThe symbol for the real numbers is R, also written as formula_19 They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a minus sign, e.g. \u2212123.456.\nMost real numbers can only be \"approximated\" by decimal numerals, in which a decimal point is placed to the right of the digit with place value\u00a01. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents , or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its fractional part has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02. Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern. Such a decimal is called a repeating decimal. Thus can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0..\nIt turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called irrational. A famous irrational real number is the , the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. When pi is written as\nas it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that is irrational. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is\nthe square root of 2, that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions of digits.\nNot only these prominent examples but almost all real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting rounded or truncated real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only countably many. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a margin of error. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to and strictly less than (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number greater or equal to and strictly less than (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called significant digits. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001 m. If the sides of a rectangle are measured as 1.23\u00a0m and 4.56\u00a0m, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between and . Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not \"significant\". Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61.\nJust as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, 0.999..., 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number\u00a01. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places. In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros. Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000... Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the rightmost nonzero digit, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing by one the rightmost digit less than 9, and changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of a decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85. Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place. For example, 99.999... = 100.\nThe real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the least upper bound property.\nIt can be shown that any ordered field, which is also complete, is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an algebraically closed field, because they do not include a solution (often called a square root of minus one) to the algebraic equation formula_22.\nComplex numbers.\nMoving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the complex numbers. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of cubic and quadratic polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a square root of\u00a0\u22121, denoted by \"i\", a symbol assigned by Leonhard Euler, and called the imaginary unit. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form\nwhere \"a\" and \"b\" are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the complex plane, a vector space of two real dimensions. In the expression , the real number \"a\" is called the real part and \"b\" is called the imaginary part. If the real part of a complex number is\u00a00, then the number is called an imaginary number or is referred to as \"purely imaginary\"; if the imaginary part is\u00a00, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a Gaussian integer. The symbol for the complex numbers is C or formula_24.\nThe fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that the complex numbers form an algebraically closed field, meaning that every polynomial with complex coefficients has a root in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a field, which is complete, but unlike the real numbers, it is not ordered. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that \"i\" is greater than\u00a01, nor is there any meaning in saying that \"i\" is less than\u00a01. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a total order that is compatible with field operations.\nSubclasses of the integers.\nEven and odd numbers.\nAn even number is an integer that is \"evenly divisible\" by two, that is divisible by two without remainder; an odd number is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term \"evenly divisible\" is now almost always shortened to \"divisible\".) Any odd number \"n\" may be constructed by the formula for a suitable integer \"k\". Starting with the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number \"m\" has the form where \"k\" is again an integer. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.\nPrime numbers.\nA prime number, often shortened to just prime, is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered. The study of these questions belongs to number theory. Goldbach's conjecture is an example of a still unanswered question: \"Is every even number the sum of two primes?\"\nOne answered question, as to whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, was confirmed; this proven claim is called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. A proof appears in Euclid's Elements.\nOther classes of integers.\nMany subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are Fibonacci numbers and perfect numbers. For more examples, see Integer sequence.\nSubclasses of the complex numbers.\nAlgebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers.\nAlgebraic numbers are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a monic polynomial equation with integer coefficients are called algebraic integers.\nConstructible numbers.\nMotivated by the classical problems of constructions with straightedge and compass, the constructible numbers are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps.\nComputable numbers.\nA computable number, also known as \"recursive number\", is a real number such that there exists an algorithm which, given a positive number \"n\" as input, produces the first \"n\" digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using \u03bc-recursive functions, Turing machines or \u03bb-calculus. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a polynomial, and thus form a real closed field that contains the real algebraic numbers.\nThe computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.\nThe set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, almost all real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.\nExtensions of the concept.\n\"p\"-adic numbers.\nThe \"p\"-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what base is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a prime number base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the \"p\"-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.\nThe elements of an algebraic function field over a finite field and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see Function field analogy). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The \"p\"-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.\nHypercomplex numbers.\nSome number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called hypercomplex numbers. They include the quaternions H, introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, in which multiplication is not commutative, the octonions, in which multiplication is not associative in addition to not being commutative, and the sedenions, in which multiplication is not alternative, neither associative nor commutative.\nTransfinite numbers.\nFor dealing with infinite sets, the natural numbers have been generalized to the ordinal numbers and to the cardinal numbers. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.\nNonstandard numbers.\nHyperreal numbers are used in non-standard analysis. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *R), denote an ordered field that is a proper extension of the ordered field of real numbers R and satisfies the transfer principle. This principle allows true first-order statements about R to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *R.\nSuperreal and surreal numbers extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form fields."}

The dance is also known as \"Two Step\" and was \"one of the most popular forms of contemporary social dance\" as a Disco Couples Dance in 1978. It is frequently danced to mid-tempo ballads in time that have a characteristic quick-quick-slow beat. A classic example is the song \"Lady In Red\".\nDescription.\nThe nightclub two step basic step can be counted as one &amp; two - three &amp; four -.\nThe dance position for nightclub two step is with a more relaxed hold, or \"what people tend to do without lessons\". The lead rocks back on their left foot, the follow on their right, for one beat. \"The toe is to the heel, but not further. Don't twist your hip. If your hip opens up, you have gone too far.\"\n A gentle but noticeable resistance is maintained during the rock step. Then both partners replace weight on the second part of the first beat. On the next beat, the lead takes a step to the left and the follow to the right. Then both partners repeat, but on opposite feet (the lead rocks back on their right foot and moves to the right).\nThe quick rock steps should be matched with the quick drum beats in the music. The \"slow\" drum beat and slow step can occur on either the second and fourth, or the first and third beats of a measure. Although other rhythmic interpretations of the music are possible, including the use of \"breaks\" in the music, they are beyond the scope of this article.\nAnother pattern in NC2S is the side-cross-side move. Typically, the lead starts this move by stepping side with their left foot and then crosses in front with their right foot. This is followed by another step to the side with the left foot. The rhythm, here, is quick, quick, slow. The follow does the same thing, but starts with their right foot. Both partners cross in front. In an interview with Phil Seyer Buddy said he created this move by modifying something that was popular in the 60's called the \"Surfer Stomp.\" The surfer stomp was simply, \"side, together, side, touch.\" In the DVIDA Nightclub Two-Step syllabus, this action is called a Traveling Cross.\nUCWDC lists a narrow range of 54-64 beats per minute for the dance."}
{"id": "21692", "revid": "42536815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21692", "title": "No wave", "text": "No wave is a music genre, named for the transient avant-garde music and visual art scene from which it emerged in the late 1970s in downtown New York City.\nThe term \"no wave\" was a pun based on the rejection of commercial new wave music. Reacting against punk rock's recycling of rock and roll clich\u00e9s, no wave musicians instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock genres like free jazz and disco while often reflecting an abrasive, confrontational, and nihilistic worldview.\nThe movement was short-lived but highly influential in the music world. Aside from the music genre, the no wave movement also had a significant influence in independent film (no wave cinema), fashion, and visual art.\nOverview/characteristics.\nNo wave is not a clearly definable musical genre with consistent features, but it generally was characterized by a rejection of the recycling of traditional rock aesthetics, such as blues rock styles and Chuck Berry guitar riffs in punk and new wave music. Various groups drew on or explored such disparate styles as funk, jazz, blues, punk rock, and the avant garde. According to \"Village Voice\" writer Steve Anderson, the scene pursued an abrasive reductionism which \"undermined the power and mystique of a rock vanguard by depriving it of a tradition to react against\". Anderson claimed that the no wave scene represented \"New York's last stylistically cohesive avant-rock movement\".\nThere were, however, some elements common to most no-wave music, such as abrasive atonal sounds; repetitive, driving rhythms; and a tendency to emphasize musical texture over melody\u2014typical of La Monte Young's early downtown music. In the early 1980s, Downtown Manhattan's no wave scene transitioned from its abrasive origins into a more dance-oriented sound, with compilations such as ZE Records's \"Mutant Disco\" (1981) highlighting a playful sensibility borne out of the city's clash of hip hop, disco and punk styles, as well as dub reggae and world music influences.\nNo wave music presented a negative and nihilistic world view that reflected the desolation of late 1970s downtown New York and how they viewed the larger society. In a 2020 essay, Lydia Lunch stated there were many problems in the years that led into the 1970s, and that calling 1967 the Summer of Love was a bold-faced lie. The term \"no wave\" might have been inspired by the French New Wave pioneer Claude Chabrol, with his remark \"There are no waves, only the ocean\".\nEtymology.\nThere are different theories about how the term was coined. Some suggest Lydia Lunch coined the term in an interview with Roy Trakin in \"New York Rocker\". Others suggest it was coined by Chris Nelson (of Mofungo and The Scene Is Now) in \"New York Rocker\". Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth claimed to see the term spray-painted on CBGB Second Avenue Theater before seeing it in the press.\nEarly forerunners.\nNihilist Spasm Band were an early noise music/noise rock band from the 1960s. Their debut record No Record, released in 1968, has been described as being a '60s precursor to no wave, with its nihilistic world view and complete disregard for any sort of musical structure, as evinced by the freely improvised noise of songs such as \"Destroy The Nations\" and \"Dog Face Man\". The band plastered the word \"NO\" on much of their equipment and handmade instruments, and recorded a film between 1965 and 1966 entitled \"NO Movie\". Member Bill Exley would sometimes wear a monkey mask on stage to conceal his identity.They've been cited as an influence by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth.\nThe Velvet Underground were a 1960s New York City band, are also seen as early contributors to the no wave movement. As described by Pitchfork's Marc Masters: \"Mixing the noisy rock leanings of Lou Reed, the minimalist drones of John Cale (via his work with avant-garde pioneer LaMonte Young), and the art world influence of Andy Warhol's Factory, this seminal band provided a comprehensive model for No Wave.\"\nThe Godz were a New York City-based psychedelic noise band connected to ESP-Disk. John Dougan opined in AllMusic: \" the three squalling bits of avant-garde noise/junk they recorded from 1966-1968. Sounding like a prototype for Half Japanese or the Shaggs..\"\nCromagnon were a 1960s New York City band whose sole album Orgasm was cited by AllMusic's Alex Henderson as foreshadowing no-wave.\nSuicide were a New York City band that was formed in 1970 by Alan Vega and Martin Rev, they've been cited by Pitchfork's Marc Masters as having \"the biggest influence on no-wave\".\nJack Ruby were a New York City band that formed in 1973, they were an early influence on Sonic Youth and Thurston Moore, and are seen as early pioneers of the aesthetic, philosophy, and sound of no wave.\nThe no-wave music scene.\nIn 1978, a punk subculture-influenced noise series was held at New York's Artists Space. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham began experimenting with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the compilation \"No New York\", often considered the quintessential testament to the scene. The no wave-affiliated label ZE Records was founded in 1978, and would also produce acclaimed and influential compilations in subsequent years.\nBy the early 1980s, artists such as Liquid Liquid, the B-52's, Cristina, Arthur Russell, James White and the Blacks and Lizzy Mercier Descloux developed a dance-oriented style described by Lucy Sante as \"anything at all + disco bottom\". Other no-wave groups such as Swans, Suicide, Glenn Branca, the Lounge Lizards, Bush Tetras and Sonic Youth instead continued exploring the forays into noise music abrasive territory. For example, Noise Fest was an influential festival of no wave noise music performances curated by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth at the New York City art space White Columns in June 1981. Sonic Youth made their first live appearances at this show. It inspired Speed Trials, the noise rock five-night concert series held May 4\u20138, 1983, that was organized by Live Skull members in May 1983, also at White Columns (then located at 91 Horatio Street). Among an art installation created by David Wojnarowicz and Joseph Nechvatal, Speed Trials included performances by the Fall, Sonic Youth, Lydia Lunch, Mofungo, Ilona Granet, pre-rap Beastie Boys, 3 Teens Kill 4, Elliott Sharp as Carbon, Swans, the Ordinaires, and Arto Lindsay as Toy Killers. On May 10, the San Francisco noise-punk band Flipper closed the series out with a live concert at Studio 54. This event also included performances by Zev and Eric Bogosian and a video presentation by Tony Oursler. Speed Trials was followed by the short-lived after-hours audio art Speed Club that was established by Nechvatal and Bradley Eros at ABC No Rio that summer.\nOther art mediums in the no wave scene.\nCinema.\nNo wave cinema was an underground film scene in Tribeca and the East Village. Filmmakers included Amos Poe, Eric Mitchell, Charlie Ahearn, Vincent Gallo, James Nares, Jim Jarmusch, Vivienne Dick, Scott B and Beth B and Seth Tillett, and led to the Cinema of Transgression and work by Nick Zedd and Richard Kern.\nVisual art.\nVisual artists played a large role in the no wave scene, as visual artists often were playing in bands, or making videos and films, while making visual art for exhibition. An early influence on this aspect of the scene was Alan Vega (aka Alan Suicide) whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the music group Suicide, which he formed with fellow musician Martin Rev in 1970. They released \"Suicide\", their first album, in 1977.\nImportant exhibitions of no wave visual art were Colab's organization of \"The Real Estate Show\", \"The Times Square Show\", \"Just Another Asshole Show\", \"Jay Street Film Shows\", and \"Island of Negative Utopia\" (at The Kitchen).\nNo wave art found an ongoing home on the Lower East Side with the establishment of ABC No Rio Gallery in 1980, and a no wave punk aesthetic was a dominant strand in the art galleries of the East Village (from 1982 to 1986).\nLegacy.\nIn a foreword to the book \"No Wave\", Weasel Walter wrote of the movement's ongoing influence:\nI began to express myself musically in a way that felt true to myself, constantly pushing the limits of idiom or genre and always screaming \"Fuck You!\" loudly in the process. It's how I felt then and I still feel it now. The ideals behind the (anti-) movement known as No Wave were found in many other archetypes before and just as many afterwards, but for a few years around the late 1970s, the concentration of those ideals reached a cohesive, white-hot focus.\nIn 2004, Scott Crary made the documentary \"Kill Your Idols\", including such no wave bands as Suicide, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, DNA and Glenn Branca as well as bands influenced by no wave, including Sonic Youth, Swans, Foetus and others.\nIn 2007\u20132008, three books on the scene were published: Soul Jazz's \"New York Noise\", Marc Masters' \"No Wave\", and Thurston Moore and Byron Coley's \"No Wave: Post-Punk. Underground. New York. 1976\u20131980\".\nColeen Fitzgibbon and Alan W. Moore created a short film in 1978 (finished in 2009) of a New York City no wave concert to benefit Colab titled \"X Magazine Benefit\", documenting performances by DNA, James Chance and the Contortions, and Boris Policeband. Shot in black and white and edited on video, the film captured the gritty look and sound of the music scene during that era. In 2013, it was exhibited at Salon 94, an art gallery in New York City."}

(later NeXT Computer, Inc. and NeXT Software, Inc.) was an American technology company that specialized in computer workstations intended for higher education and business use. Based in Redwood City, California, and founded by Apple Computer co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs after he was forced out of Apple, the company introduced their first product, the NeXT Computer, in 1988, and then the smaller NeXTcube and NeXTstation in 1990. These computers had relatively limited sales, with only about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces were trendsetters of computer innovation, and highly influential.\nNeXT partnered with Sun Microsystems to create a programming environment called OpenStep, which was the NeXTSTEP operating system's application layer hosted on a third-party operating system. In 1993, NeXT withdrew from the hardware industry to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP for Mach, its own OpenStep implementation, for several other computer vendors. NeXT also developed WebObjects, one of the first enterprise web application frameworks, and although its market appeal was limited by its high $50,000 price, it is a prominent early example of a web server that is based on dynamic page generation rather than static content.\nApple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $400 million, which included 1.5 million shares of Apple stock, and Jobs, the chairman and CEO of NeXT, was given an advisory role at Apple. Apple also promised that NeXT's operating system would be ported to Macintosh hardware, and combined with the classic Mac OS operating system, which would yield Mac OS X, later called macOS.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn 1985, Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs led a division campaign called SuperMicro, which was responsible for developing the Macintosh and Lisa computers. They were commercial successes on university campuses because Jobs had personally visited a few notable universities to promote his products, and also because of Apple University Consortium, a marketing program that allowed academics to buy them at a discount. The Consortium had earned over $50 million on computer sales by February 1984.\nJobs met Paul Berg, a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, at a luncheon held in Silicon Valley to honor President of France Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Berg was frustrated by the time and expense of researching recombinant DNA via wet laboratories, and suggested that Jobs should use his influence to create a \"3M computer\" that is designed for higher education use.\nJobs was intrigued by Berg's concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher-education computer company in late 1985, amid increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs's division did not release the upgraded versions of the Macintosh computer and much of the Macintosh Office software. As a result its sales plummeted, and Apple was forced to write off millions of dollars in unsold inventory. In 1985, John Sculley ousted Jobs from his executive role at Apple and replaced him with Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e. Later that year, Jobs began a power struggle to regain control over his company. The board of directors sided with Sculley, and Jobs took a business trip to Western Europe and the Soviet Union on behalf of Apple.\nOriginal NeXT team.\nIn September 1985, after several months of being sidelined, Jobs resigned from Apple. He told the board he was leaving to set up a new computer company, and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him, but he also promised that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing their designs to them under the Macintosh brand.\nA number of former Apple employees followed him to NeXT, including Joanna Hoffman, Bud Tribble, George Crow, Rich Page, Susan Barnes, Susan Kare, and Dan'l Lewin. After consulting with major educational buyers from around the country, including a follow-up meeting with Paul Berg, a tentative specification for the workstation was drawn up. It was designed to be powerful enough to run wet-lab simulations and affordable enough for college students to use in their dormitory rooms. Before the specifications were finished, however, Apple sued NeXT on September 23, 1985, for \"nefarious schemes\" to take advantage of the cofounders' insider information. Jobs argued, \"It is hard to think that a $2 billion company with 4,300-plus people couldn't compete with six people in blue jeans.\" The suit was eventually dismissed before trial.\nIn 1986, Jobs recruited the graphic designer Paul Rand to create a brand identity for . Jobs recalled, \"I asked him if he would come up with a few options, and he said, 'No, I will solve your problem for you and you will pay me. You don't have to use the solution. If you want options go talk to other people. Rand created a 20-page brochure detailing the brand, including the precise angle used for the logo (28\u00b0) and a new company name spelling, NeXT.\n1987\u20131993: NeXT Computer.\nFirst generation.\nIn mid-1986, NeXT changed its business plan to develop both computer hardware and software, rather than just workstations. Rich Page, a NeXT cofounder who formerly directed Apple Lisa's team, led a team to develop the hardware, while Mach kernel engineer Avie Tevanian led the development of NeXT's operating system, NeXTSTEP. NeXT's first factory was established in Fremont, California in 1987, and it was capable of manufacturing about 150,000 machines per year. NeXT's first workstation was named the NeXT Computer. It was also nicknamed as \"the cube\" due to its distinctive magnesium cubic case. The case was designed by Hartmut Esslinger and his team at Frog Design.\nIn 1987, Ross Perot became NeXT's first major outside-investor. He invested $20 million for 16% of NeXT's stock after seeing a segment about NeXT on a 1986 PBS documentary titled \"Entrepreneurs\". In 1988, he joined the company's board of directors.\nNeXT and Adobe collaborated on Display PostScript (DPS), a 2D graphics engine that was released in 1987. NeXT engineers wrote an alternative windowing engine edition to take full advantage of NeXTSTEP. NeXT engineers used Display PostScript to draw on-screen graphic designs such as title-bar and scroller for NeXTSTEP's user-space windowing system library.\nThe original design team anticipated to complete the computer in early 1987 and launch it for by mid-year. On October 12, 1988, the NeXT Computer received standing ovations when it was revealed at a private gala event, \"NeXT Introductionthe Introduction to the NeXT Generation of Computers for Education\" at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, California. The following day, selected educators and software engineers were invited to attend the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at the event \"The NeXT Day\" held at the San Francisco Hilton. The event gave developers interested in NeXT software an insight into their architecture, object-oriented programming, and the NeXT Computer. The luncheon speaker was Steve Jobs.\nThe first NeXT Computers were experimented in 1989, after which NeXT sold a limited number of these devices to universities with a beta version of the NeXTSTEP operating system pre-installed. Initially, the NeXT Computer targeted the United States higher-education institutions only, with a base price of . The computer was widely reviewed in magazines, primarily the hardware portion. When asked if he was upset that the computer's debut was delayed by several months, Jobs responded, \"Late? This computer is five years ahead of its time!\"\nThe NeXT Computer was based on the 25\u00a0MHz Motorola 68030 central processing unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but it was not available in sufficient quantities. The computer included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus, and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989, a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640\u00d7480 16-color or a 320x240 4,096-color display, a 10- to 20-megabyte hard drive, and few networking capabilities. It was the first computer to ship with a general-purpose DSP chip (Motorola 56001) on the motherboard. This supported sophisticated music and sound processing, including the Music Kit software.\nThe magneto-optical (MO) drive manufactured by Canon Inc. was the primary mass storage device. This drive technology was relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use it. MO drives were cheaper but much slower than hard drives, with an average seek time of 96 ms; Jobs negotiated Canon's initial price of $150 per blank MO disk so that they could sell at retail for only $50. The disk drive's design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, because each NeXT Computer has only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. The drive's limited speed and capacity made it insufficient as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system.\nIn 1989, NeXT struck a deal for former Compaq reseller Businessland to sell the NeXT Computer in international markets. Selling through a retailer was a major change from NeXT's original business model of only selling directly to students and educational institutions. Businessland founder David Norman predicted that sales of the NeXT Computer would surpass sales of Compaq computers after 12 months.\nThat same year, Canon invested US$100 million in NeXT, for a 16.67 percent stake, making NeXT worth almost $600 million. Canon invested in NeXT with the condition of installing the NeXTSTEP environment on its own workstations, which would mean a greatly expanded market for the software. After NeXT exited the hardware business, Canon produced a line of PCs called \"object.station\"\u2014including models 31, 41, 50, and 52\u2014specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP on Intel chips. Canon also served as NeXT's distributor in Japan.\nThe NeXT Computer was released in 1990 for . In June 1991, Perot resigned from the board of directors to concentrate more time in his company, Perot Systems, a Plano, Texas\u2013based software system integrator.\nSecond generation.\nIn 1990, NeXT released a second generation of workstations: a revised NeXT Computer NeXTcube and the NeXTstation. The NeXTstation was nicknamed \"the slab\" for its low-rise box form-factor. Jobs ensured that NeXT staffers did not nickname the NeXTstation \"pizza box\" to avoid inadvertent comparison with competitor Sun workstations, which already had that nickname.\nThe machines were initially planned to use the 2.88\u00a0MB floppy drive, but the 2.88\u00a0MB floppy disks were expensive, and its technology failed to supplant the 1.44\u00a0MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT used the CD-ROM drive instead, which would eventually become the standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and NeXTdimension graphics processor hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers, with the new Motorola 68040 processor, were cheaper and faster than their predecessors.\nIn 1992, NeXT launched \"Turbo\" variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation, with a 33\u00a0MHz 68040 processor and the maximum RAM capacity increased to 128\u00a0MB. In 1992, NeXT sold 20,000 computers, counting upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales. This was a small number compared with competitors, but the company reported sales of $140 million for the year, which encouraged Canon to invest a further $30 million to keep the company afloat.\nIn total, 50,000 NeXT machines were sold, including thousands to the then super-secret National Reconnaissance Office located in Chantilly, Virginia. NeXT's long-term plan was to migrate to one of the emerging high-performance Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures, with the NeXT RISC Workstation (NRW). Initially, the NRW was to be based on the Motorola 88110 processor, but it was later redesigned around dual PowerPC 601s, due to a lack of confidence in Motorola's commitment to the 88000-series architecture in the time leading up to the AIM alliance's transition to PowerPC.\n1993\u20131996: NeXT Software, Inc..\nIn late 1991, because of NeXT's future withdrawal from the hardware industry, the company started porting the NeXTSTEP operating system to the Intel 80486-based IBM PC compatible computers. In January 1992, a demonstration of the port was shown at NeXTWorld Expo. By mid-1993 the process was completed, and version 3.1 (NeXTSTEP 486) was released.\nNeXTSTEP 3.x was later ported to PA-RISC- and SPARC-based platforms, for a total of four versions: NeXTSTEP/NeXT (for NeXT's own hardware), NeXTSTEP/Intel, NeXTSTEP/PA-RISC, and NeXTSTEP/SPARC. Although the latter three ports were not widely used, NeXTSTEP gained popularity at institutions such as First Chicago NBD, Swiss Bank Corporation, O'Connor and Company, and other organizations, owing to its programming model. The software was used by many U.S. government agencies, including the United States Naval Research Laboratory, the National Security Agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office. Some IBM PC clone vendors offered somewhat customized hardware solutions that were delivered running NeXTSTEP on Intel, such as the Elonex NextStation and the Canon object.station 41.\nIn 1993, NeXT withdrew from the hardware industry, and the company was renamed to NeXT Software, Inc. Consequently, 230 of the 530 staff employees were laid off. NeXT negotiated to sell the hardware business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon, which later pulled out of the deal. Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. Sun CEO, Scott McNealy, announced plans to invest $10 million in 1993 and use NeXT software in future Sun systems. NeXT partnered with Sun to create a programming environment called OpenStep, which is NeXTSTEP's application layer hosted on a third party operating system. In 1994, Microsoft and NeXT were collaborating on a Windows NT port of OpenStep which was never released.\nStepstone, originally named Productivity Products International (PPI), was a software company founded in 1983 by Brad Cox and Tom Love, best known for releasing the original version of the Objective-C programming language. In April 1995, NeXT acquired the Objective-C trademark and rights from Stepstone. At the same time, Stepstone licensed back from NeXT the right to continue selling their Objective-C based products. As Apple Computer acquired NeXT a year later, they now hold the rights to Objective-C. The U.S. software company Stepstone appears to have gone out of business in the early 2000s. \nAfter exiting the hardware business, NeXT focused on other operating systems. New products based on OpenStep were released, including OpenStep Enterprise, a version for Microsoft's Windows NT. NeXT launched WebObjects, a platform for building large-scale dynamic web applications. It failed to achieve wide popularity, partly because of the initial high price of US$50,000; but it remains the first and most prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions as opposed to static content. The platform was bundled with macOS Server and Xcode, but was removed in 2009 and discontinued in 2016. It was used for a short of period of time by many large businesses, including Dell, Disney, WorldCom, and the BBC. WebObjects would eventually be used to power Apple's iTunes Store and most of its corporate website for years, with parts of the iTunes Store and Apple Music remaining powered by it to this day.\n1996\u20132006: Acquisition by Apple.\nOn December 20, 1996, Apple Computer announced its intention to acquire NeXT. Apple paid $400 million in cash and shares. Though Steve Jobs preferred to only receive cash, Gil Amelio insisted he take 1.5 million Apple shares to give the deal \"credibility\". The main purpose of the acquisition was to use NeXTSTEP as a foundation to replace the dated classic Mac OS. The deal was finalized on February 7, 1997, bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant, who was later appointed as interim CEO. In 2000, Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment, holding the position until his resignation on August 24, 2011, shortly before his death on October 5, 2011.\nSeveral NeXT executives replaced their Apple counterparts when Jobs restructured the company's board of directors. Over the next five years the NeXTSTEP operating system was ported to the PowerPC architecture. At the same time, an Intel port and OpenStep Enterprise toolkit for Windows were both produced. That operating system was code-named Rhapsody, while the crossplatform toolkit was called \"Yellow Box\". For backward compatibility, Apple added the \"Blue Box\" to Rhapsody, allowing existing Mac applications to be run in a self-contained cooperative multitasking environment.\nA server version of the new operating system was released as Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999, and the first consumer version, Mac OS X 10.0, in 2001. The OpenStep developer toolkit was renamed Cocoa. Rhapsody's Blue Box was renamed Classic Environment and changed to run applications full-screen without requiring a separate window. Apple included an updated version of the original Macintosh toolbox, called Carbon, that gave existing Mac applications access to the environment without the constraints of Blue Box. Some of NeXTSTEP's interface features are used in Mac OS X, including the Dock, the Services menu, the Finder's \"Column\" view, and the Cocoa text system.\nNeXTSTEP's processor-independent capabilities were retained in Mac OS X, leading to PowerPC, x86, and ARM versions (although only PowerPC versions were publicly available before 2006 and were discontinued by 2009, and ARM versions were not available until 2020). Apple moved to Intel processors by August 2006, and is in the process of moving to ARM processors as of September 2022.\nCorporate culture and community.\nJobs created a different corporate culture at NeXT in terms of facilities, salaries, and benefits. Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple, but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a \"community\" with \"members\" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid and those who joined afterward were paid . This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Later, employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege. NeXT's health insurance plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications. The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time, because instead of employees being paid twice a month at the end of the pay period, they were paid once a month in advance.\nJobs found office space in Palo Alto, California, at 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass-and-concrete building that featured a staircase designed by the architect I. M. Pei. The first floor had hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the just-in-time (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major components, such as mainboards and cases, and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. On the second floor was office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.\nAs NeXT expanded, more office space was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive, in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a \"floating\" staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, with furnishings that were luxurious, such as $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and Ansel Adams prints.\nNeXT's Palo Alto office was subsequently occupied by Internet Shopping Network (a subsidiary of Home Shopping Network) in 1994, and later by SAP AG. Its Redwood City office was later occupied by ApniCure and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nThe first issue of \"NeXTWORLD\" magazine was printed in 1991. It was edited by Michael Miley and, later, Dan Ruby and was published in San Francisco by Integrated Media. It was the only mainstream periodical to discuss NeXT computers, their operating system, and NeXT application software. The publication was discontinued in 1994 after only four volumes. A developer conference, \"NeXTWORLD Expo\", was held in 1991 and 1992 at the San Francisco Civic Center and in 1993 and 1994 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, with Jobs as the keynote speaker.\nLegacy.\nThough not very profitable, the company had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. Object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP. The technologically successful platform was often held as the trendsetter when other companies started to emulate the success of NeXT's object-oriented system.\nWidely seen as a response to NeXT, Microsoft announced the Cairo project in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar object-oriented user-interface features for a coming consumer version of Windows NT. Although Cairo was ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects.\nBy 1993, Taligent was considered by the press to be a competitor in objects and operating systems, even without any product release, with NeXT being a main point of comparison. For the first few years, Taligent's theoretical innovation was often compared to NeXT's older but mature and commercially established platform, but Taligent's debut release in 1995 was called \"too little, too late\", especially when compared with NeXT.\nSeveral developers used the NeXT platform to write pioneering programs. For example, in 1990, Computer Scientist Tim Berners-Lee used a NeXT Computer to develop the first web browser and web server. The game series \"Doom\", and \"Quake\" were developed by id Software with NeXT computers. Other commercial programs were released for NeXT computers, including Altsys Virtuoso\u2014a vector-drawing program with page-layout features, which was ported to Mac OS and Microsoft Windows as Aldus FreeHand v4\u2014and the Lotus Improv spreadsheet program."}

{"id": "21699", "revid": "41517156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21699", "title": "Nineveh", "text": "Nineveh (; ; Biblical Hebrew: '; '; ) was an ancient Assyrian city of Upper Mesopotamia, located in the modern-day city of Mosul in northern Iraq. It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as the largest city in the world for several decades. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country's Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.\nIt was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, Persians, Scythians and Cimmerians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of a Christian bishop. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 13th century AD.\nIts ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul, in Iraq's Nineveh Governorate. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus, site of a shrine to Jonah, the prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large amounts of Assyrian sculpture and other artifacts have been excavated there, and are now located in museums around the world.\nName.\nThe English placename Nineveh comes from Latin ' and Septuagint Greek \"Nineu\u1e17\" () under influence of the Biblical Hebrew \"N\u012bn\u0259weh\" (), from the Akkadian ' ( \"Nin\u00e2\") or Old Babylonian \"\". The original meaning of the name is unclear but may have referred to a patron goddess. The cuneiform for \"Nin\u00e2\" () is a fish within a house (cf. Aramaic \"nuna\", \"fish\"). This may have simply intended \"Place of Fish\" or may have indicated a goddess associated with fish or the Tigris, possibly originally of Hurrian origin. The city was later said to be devoted to \"the goddess Ishtar of Nineveh\" and \"Nina\" was one of the Sumerian and Assyrian names of that goddess.\nAdditionally, the word \u05e0\u05d5\u05df/\u05e0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d0 in Old Babylonian refers to the Anthiinae genus of fish, further indicating the possibility of an association between the name Nineveh and fish.\nThe city was also known as \"Ninuwa\" in Mari; \"Ninawa\" in Aramaic; Ninwe (\u0722\u0738\u0722\u0718\u0735\u0710) in Syriac; and \"Nainav\u0101\" () in Persian.\n\"Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus\" is the Arabic for \"Prophet Jonah\". \"Kuyunjiq\" was, according to Layard, a Turkish name (Layard used the form \"kouyunjik\", diminutive of \"koyun\", \"sheep\" in Turkish), and it was known as \"Armousheeah\" by the Arabs, and is thought to have some connection with the Kara Koyunlu dynasty. These toponyms refer to the areas to the North and South of the Khosr stream, respectively: Kuyunjiq is the name for the whole northern sector enclosed by the city walls and is dominated by the large (35 ha) mound of Tell Kuyunjiq, while Nab\u012b (or more commonly Nebi) Yunus is the southern sector around of the mosque of Prophet Yunus/Jonah, which is located on Tell Nebi Yunus.\nGeography.\nThe remains of ancient Nineveh, the areas of Kuyunjiq and Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus with their mounds, are located on a level part of the plain at the junction of the Tigris and the Khosr Rivers within an area of circumscribed by a fortification wall. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins overlaid by c. one third by the Nebi Yunus suburbs of the city of eastern Mosul.\nThe site of ancient Nineveh is bisected by the Khosr river. North of the Khosr, the site is called Kuyunjiq, including the acropolis of Tell Kuyunjiq; the illegal village of Rahmaniye lay in eastern Kuyunjiq. South of the Khosr, the urbanized area is called Nebi Yunus (also Ghazliya, Jezayr, Jammasa), including Tell Nebi Yunus where the mosque of the Prophet Jonah and a palace of Esarhaddon/Ashurbanipal below it are located. South of the street Al-'Asady (made by Daesh destroying swaths of the city walls) the area is called Jounub Ninawah or Shara Pepsi.\nNineveh was an important junction for commercial routes crossing the Tigris on the great roadway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, thus uniting the East and the West, it received wealth from many sources, so that it became one of the greatest of all the region's ancient cities, and the last capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nNineveh was one of the oldest and greatest cities in antiquity. Texts from the Hellenistic period later offered an eponymous Ninus as the founder of \u039d\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 (Ninopolis), although there is no historical basis for this. Book of Genesis 10:11 says \"Nimrod\", possibly meaning Sargon I, built Nineveh. The context of Nineveh was as one of many centers within the regional development of Upper Mesopotamia. This area is defined as the plains which can support rain-fed agriculture. It exists as a narrow band from the Syrian coast to the Zagros mountains. It is bordered by deserts to the south and mountains to the north. The cultural practices, technology, and economy in this region were shared and they followed a similar trajectory out of the neolithic.\nNeolithic.\nCaves in the Zagros Mountains adjacent to the north side of the Nineveh Plains were used as PPNA settlements, most famously Shanidar Cave. Nineveh itself was founded as early as 6000\u00a0BC during the late Neolithic period. Deep sounding at Nineveh uncovered soil layers that have been dated to early in the era of the Hassuna archaeological culture. The development and culture of Nineveh paralleled Tepe Gawra and Tell Arpachiyah a few kilometers to the northeast. Nineveh was a typical farming village in the Halaf Period.\nChalcolithic.\nIn 5000 BC, Nineveh transitioned from a Halaf village to an Ubaid village. During the Late Chalcolithic period Nineveh was part one of the few Ubaid villages in Upper Mesopotamia which became a proto-city Ugarit, Brak, Hamoukar, Arbela, Alep, and regionally at Susa, Eridu, Nippur. During the period between 4500 and 4000 BC it grew to 40ha.\nThe greater Nineveh area is notable in the diffusion of metal technology across the near east as the first location outside of Anatolia to smelt copper. Tell Arpachiyah has the oldest copper smelting remains, and Tepe Gawa has the oldest metal work. The copper came from the mines at Ergani.\nEarly Bronze Age.\nNineveh became a trade colony of Uruk during the Uruk Expansion because of its location as the highest navigable point on the Tigris. It was contemporary and had a similar function to Habuba Kabira on the Euphrates. By 3000\u00a0BC, Kish civilization had expanded into Nineveh. At this time, the main temple of Nineveh becomes known as Ishtar temple, re-dedicated to the Semite goddess Ishtar, in the form of Ishtar of Nineveh. Ishtar of Nineveh was conflated with \u0160au\u0161ka from the Hurro-Urartian pantheon. This temple was called 'House of Exorcists' (Cuneiform: \ud808\udcb7\ud808\ude26\ud808\ude26 GA2.MA\u0160.MA\u0160; Sumerian: e2 ma\u0161ma\u0161). The context of the etymology surrounding the name is the Exorcist called a Mashmash in Sumerian, was a freelance magician who operated independent of the official priesthood, and was in part a medical professional via the act of expelling demons.\nNinevite 5 period.\nThe regional influence of Nineveh became particularly pronounced during the archaeological period known as \"Ninevite 5\", or \"Ninevite V\" (2900\u20132600 BC). This period is defined primarily by the characteristic pottery that is found widely throughout Upper Mesopotamia. Also, for the Upper Mesopotamian region, the \"Early Jezirah\" chronology has been developed by archaeologists. According to this regional chronology, 'Ninevite 5' is equivalent to the Early Jezirah I\u2013II period.\nNinevite 5 was preceded by the Late Uruk period. Ninevite 5 pottery is roughly contemporary to the Early Transcaucasian culture ware, and the Jemdet Nasr period ware. Iraqi \"Scarlet Ware\" culture also belongs to this period; this colourful painted pottery is somewhat similar to Jemdet Nasr ware. Scarlet Ware was first documented in the Diyala River basin in Iraq. Later, it was also found in the nearby Hamrin Basin, and in Luristan. It is also contemporary with the Proto-Elamite period in Susa.\nAkkadian period.\nAt this time Nineveh was still an autonomous city-state. It was incorporated into the Akkadian Empire. The early city (and subsequent buildings) was constructed on a fault line and, consequently, suffered damage from a number of earthquakes. One such event destroyed the first temple of Ishtar, which was rebuilt in 2260\u00a0BC by the Akkadian king Manishtushu.\nUr III period.\nIn the final phase of the Early Bronze, Mesopotamia was dominated by the Ur III empire.\nMiddle Bronze.\nAfter the fall of Ur in 2000 BC, with the transition into the Middle Bronze, Nineveh was absorbed into the rising power of Assyria.\nOld Assyrian period.\nThe historic Nineveh is mentioned in the Old Assyrian Empire during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I (1809-1775) in about 1800\u00a0BC as a centre of worship of Ishtar, whose cult was responsible for the city's early importance.\nLate Bronze.\nMitanni period.\nThe goddess's statue was sent to Pharaoh Amenhotep III of Egypt in the 14th century BC, by orders of the king of Mitanni. The Assyrian city of Nineveh became one of Mitanni's vassals for half a century until the early 14th century BC.\nMiddle Assyrian period.\nThe Assyrian king Ashur-uballit I reclaimed it in 1365\u00a0BC while overthrowing the Mitanni Empire and creating the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365\u20131050 BC).\nThere is a large body of evidence to show that Assyrian monarchs built extensively in Nineveh during the late 3rd and 2nd millenniums BC; it appears to have been originally an \"Assyrian provincial town\". Later monarchs whose inscriptions have appeared on the high city include the Middle Assyrian Empire kings Shalmaneser I (1274\u20131245 BC) and Tiglath-Pileser I (1114\u20131076 BC), both of whom were active builders in Assur (Ashur).\nIron Age.\nNeo-Assyrians.\nDuring the Neo-Assyrian Empire, particularly from the time of Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883\u2013859\u00a0BC) onward, there was considerable architectural expansion. Successive monarchs such as Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal maintained and founded new palaces, as well as temples to S\u00een, Ashur, Nergal, Shamash, Ninurta, Ishtar, Tammuz, Nisroch and Nabu.\nSennacherib's development of Nineveh.\nIt was Sennacherib who made Nineveh a truly magnificent city (c. 700\u00a0BC). He laid out new streets and squares and built within it the South West Palace, or \"palace without a rival\", the plan of which has been mostly recovered and has overall dimensions of about . It comprised at least 80 rooms, many of which were lined with sculpture. A large number of cuneiform tablets were found in the palace. The solid foundation was made out of limestone blocks and mud bricks; it was tall. In total, the foundation is made of roughly of brick (approximately 160\u00a0million bricks). The walls on top, made out of mud brick, were an additional tall.\nSome of the principal doorways were flanked by colossal stone \"lamassu\" door figures weighing up to ; these were winged Mesopotamian lions or bulls, with human heads. These were transported from quarries at Balatai, and they had to be lifted up once they arrived at the site, presumably by a ramp. There are also of stone Assyrian palace reliefs, that include pictorial records documenting every construction step including carving the statues and transporting them on a barge. One picture shows 44 men towing a colossal statue. The carving shows three men directing the operation while standing on the Colossus. Once the statues arrived at their destination, the final carving was done. Most of the statues weigh between .\nThe stone carvings in the walls include many battle scenes, impalings and scenes showing Sennacherib's men parading the spoils of war before him. The inscriptions boasted of his conquests: he wrote of Babylon: \"Its inhabitants, young and old, I did not spare, and with their corpses I filled the streets of the city.\" A full and characteristic set shows the campaign leading up to the siege of Lachish in 701; it is the \"finest\" from the reign of Sennacherib, and now in the British Museum. He later wrote about a battle in Lachish: \"And Hezekiah of Judah who had not submitted to my yoke...him I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city like a caged bird. Earthworks I threw up against him, and anyone coming out of his city gate I made pay for his crime. His cities which I had plundered I had cut off from his land.\"\nAt this time, the total area of Nineveh comprised about , and fifteen great gates penetrated its walls. An elaborate system of eighteen canals brought water from the hills to Nineveh, and several sections of a magnificently constructed aqueduct erected by Sennacherib were discovered at Jerwan, about distant. The enclosed area had more than 100,000 inhabitants (maybe closer to 150,000), about twice as many as Babylon at the time, placing it among the largest settlements worldwide.\nSome scholars such as Stephanie Dalley at Oxford believe that the garden which Sennacherib built next to his palace, with its associated irrigation works, were the original Hanging Gardens of Babylon; Dalley's argument is based on a disputation of the traditional placement of the Hanging Gardens attributed to Berossus together with a combination of literary and archaeological evidence.\nAfter Ashurbanipal.\nThe greatness of Nineveh was short-lived. In around 627\u00a0BC, after the death of its last great king Ashurbanipal, the Neo-Assyrian Empire began to unravel through a series of bitter civil wars between rival claimants for the throne, and in 616 BC Assyria was attacked by its own former vassals, the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, Scythians and Cimmerians. In about 616\u00a0BC Kalhu was sacked, the allied forces eventually reached Nineveh, besieging and sacking the city in 612\u00a0BC, following bitter house-to-house fighting, after which it was razed. Most of the people in the city who could not escape to the last Assyrian strongholds in the north and west were either massacred or deported out of the city and into the countryside where they founded new settlements. Many unburied skeletons were found by the archaeologists at the site. The Assyrian Empire then came to an end by 605\u00a0BC, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its colonies between themselves.\nIt is not clear whether Nineveh came under the rule of the Medes or the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 612. The Babylonian \"Chronicle Concerning the Fall of Nineveh\" records that Nineveh was \"turned into mounds and heaps\", but this is literary hyperbole. The complete destruction of Nineveh has traditionally been seen as confirmed by the Hebrew \"Book of Ezekiel\" and the Greek \"Retreat of the Ten Thousand\" of Xenophon (d.\u00a0354\u00a0BC). There are no later cuneiform tablets in Akkadian from Nineveh. Although devastated in 612, the city was not completely abandoned. Yet, to the Greek historians Ctesias and Herodotus (c.\u00a0400\u00a0BC), Nineveh was a thing of the past; and when Xenophon passed the place in the 4th century BC he described it as abandoned.\nLater history.\nThe earliest piece of written evidence for the persistence of Nineveh as a settlement is possibly the Cyrus Cylinder of 539/538 BC, but the reading of this is disputed. If correctly read as Nineveh, it indicates that Cyrus the Great restored the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh and probably encouraged resettlement. A number of cuneiform Elamite tablets have been found at Nineveh. They probably date from the time of the revival of Elam in the century following the collapse of Assyria. The Hebrew \"Book of Jonah\", which Stephanie Dalley asserts was written in the 4th century BC, is an account of the city's repentance and God's mercy which prevented destruction.\nArchaeologically, there is evidence of repairs at the temple of Nabu after 612 and for the continued use of Sennacherib's palace. There is evidence of syncretic Hellenistic cults. A statue of Hermes has been found and a Greek inscription attached to a shrine of the Sebitti. A statue of Herakles Epitrapezios dated to the 2nd century AD has also been found. The library of Ashurbanipal may still have been in use until around the time of Alexander the Great.\nThe city was actively resettled under the Seleucid Empire. There is evidence of more changes in Sennacherib's palace under the Parthian Empire. The Parthians also established a municipal mint at Nineveh coining in bronze. According to Tacitus, in AD 50 Meherdates, a claimant to the Parthian throne with Roman support, took Nineveh.\nBy Late Antiquity, Nineveh was restricted to the east bank of the Tigris and the west bank was uninhabited. Under the Sasanian Empire, Nineveh was not an administrative centre. By the 2nd century AD there were Christians present and by 554 it was a bishopric of the Church of the East. King Khosrow II (591\u2013628) built a fortress on the west bank, and two Christian monasteries were constructed around 570 and 595. This growing settlement was not called Mosul until after the Arab conquests. It may have been called Hesn\u0101 \u02bfEbr\u0101y\u0113 (Jews' Fort).\nIn 627, the city was the site of the Battle of Nineveh between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sasanians. In 641, it was conquered by the Arabs, who built a mosque on the west bank and turned it into an administrative centre. Under the Umayyad dynasty, it eclipsed Nineveh, which was reduced to a Christian suburb with limited new construction. By the 13th century, Nineveh was mostly ruins. A church was converted into a Muslim shrine to the prophet Jonah, which continued to attract pilgrims until its destruction by ISIL in 2014.\nBiblical Nineveh.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, Nineveh is first mentioned in Genesis 10:11: \"Ashur left that land, and built Nineveh\". Some modern English translations interpret \"Ashur\" in the Hebrew of this verse as the country \"Assyria\" rather than a person, thus making Nimrod, rather than Ashur, the founder of Nineveh. Sir Walter Raleigh's notion that Nimrod built Nineveh, and the cities in Genesis 10:11\u201312, has also been refuted by scholars. The discovery of the fifteen Jubilees texts found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls has since shown that, according to the Jewish sects of Qumran, Genesis 10:11 affirms the apportionment of Nineveh to Ashur. The attribution of Nineveh to Ashur is also supported by the Greek Septuagint, King James Bible, Geneva Bible, and by Roman historian Flavius Josephus in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (Antiquities, i, vi, 4).\nNineveh was the flourishing capital of the Assyrian Empire and was the home of King Sennacherib, King of Assyria, during the Biblical reign of King Hezekiah () and the lifetime of Judean prophet Isaiah (). As recorded in Hebrew scripture, Nineveh was also the place where Sennacherib died at the hands of his two sons, who then fled to the vassal land of \"`rrt\" (Urartu). The book of the prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against Nineveh. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold. Its end was strange, sudden, and tragic. According to the Bible, it was God's doing, his judgment on Assyria's pride. In fulfillment of prophecy, God made \"an utter end of the place\". It became a \"desolation\". The prophet Zephaniah also predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. Nineveh is also the setting of the Book of Tobit.\nThe Book of Jonah, set in the days of the Assyrian Empire, describes it as an \"exceedingly great city of three days' journey in breadth\", whose population at that time is given as \"more than 120,000\". Genesis 10:11\u201312 lists four cities \"Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen\", ambiguously stating that either Resen or Calah is \"the great city\". The ruins of Kuyunjiq, Nimrud, Karamlesh and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrilateral. The ruins of the \"great city\" Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The description of Nineveh in Jonah likely was a reference to greater Nineveh, including the surrounding cities of Rehoboth, Calah and Resen The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states he is showing mercy for the population who are ignorant of the difference between right and wrong (\"who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand\") and mercy for the animals in the city.\nNineveh's repentance and salvation from evil can be found in the Hebrew Tanakh, also known as the Old Testament), and referred to in the Christian New Testament and Muslim Quran. To this day, Syriac and Oriental Orthodox churches commemorate the three days Jonah spent inside the fish during the Fast of Nineveh. Some Christians observe this holiday fast by refraining from food and drink, with churches encouraging followers to refrain from meat, fish and dairy products.\nArchaeology.\nThe location of Nineveh was known, to some, continuously through the Middle Ages. Benjamin of Tudela visited it in 1170; Petachiah of Regensburg soon after.\nCarsten Niebuhr recorded its location during the 1761\u20131767 Danish expedition. Niebuhr wrote afterwards that \"I did not learn that I was at so remarkable a spot, till near the river. Then they showed me a village on a great hill, which they call Nunia, and a mosque, in which the prophet Jonah was buried. Another hill in this district is called Kalla Nunia, or the Castle of Nineveh. On that lies a village Koindsjug.\"\nExcavation history.\nIn 1842, the French Consul General at Mosul, Paul-\u00c9mile Botta, began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. While at Tell Kuyunjiq he had little success, the locals whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the 20 km far-away mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon II, in which large numbers of reliefs were found and recorded, though they had been damaged by fire and were mostly too fragile to remove.\nIn 1847 the young British diplomat Austen Henry Layard explored the ruins. Layard did not use modern archaeological methods; his stated goal was \"to obtain the largest possible number of well preserved objects of art at the least possible outlay of time and money\". In the Kuyunjiq mound, Layard rediscovered in 1849 the lost palace of Sennacherib with its 71 rooms and colossal bas-reliefs. He also unearthed the palace and famous library of Ashurbanipal with 22,000 cuneiform clay tablets. Most of Layard's material was sent to the British Museum, but others were dispersed elsewhere as two large pieces which were given to Lady Charlotte Guest and eventually found their way to the Metropolitan Museum. The study of the archaeology of Nineveh reveals the wealth and glory of ancient Assyria under kings such as Esarhaddon (681\u2013669\u00a0BC) and Ashurbanipal (669\u2013626\u00a0BC).\nThe work of exploration was carried on by Hormuzd Rassam (an Assyrian), George Smith and others, and a vast treasury of specimens of Assyria was incrementally exhumed for European museums. Palace after palace was discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs.\nThe mound of Kuyunjiq was excavated again by the archaeologists of the British Museum, led by Leonard William King, at the beginning of the 20th century. Their efforts concentrated on the site of the Temple of Nabu, the god of writing, where another cuneiform library was supposed to exist. However, no such library was ever found: most likely, it had been destroyed by the activities of later residents.\nThe excavations started again in 1927, under the direction of Campbell Thompson, who had taken part in King's expeditions. Some works were carried out outside Kuyunjiq, for instance on the mound of Tell Nebi Yunus, which was the ancient arsenal of Nineveh, or along the outside walls. Here, near the northwestern corner of the walls, beyond the pavement of a later building, the archaeologists found almost 300 fragments of prisms recording the royal annals of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal, beside a prism of Esarhaddon which was almost perfect.\nAfter the Second World War, several excavations were carried out by Iraqi archaeologists. From 1951 to 1958, Mohammed Ali Mustafa worked the site. The work was continued from 1967 through 1971 by Tariq Madhloom. Some additional excavation occurred by Manhal Jabur from the early 1970s to 1987. For the most part, these digs focused on Tell Nebi Yunus.\nThe British archaeologist and Assyriologist Professor David Stronach of the University of California, Berkeley conducted a series of surveys and digs at the site from 1987 to 1990, focusing his attentions on the several gates and the existent mudbrick walls, as well as the system that supplied water to the city in times of siege. The excavation reports are in progress.\nMost recently, an Iraqi\u2013Italian Archaeological Expedition by the Alma Mater Studiorum \u2013 University of Bologna and the Iraqi SBAH, led by Nicol\u00f2 Marchetti, began (with four campaigns having taken place thus far between 2019 and 2022) a long-term project aiming at the excavation, conservation and public presentation of the lower town of Nineveh. Work was carried out in eighteen excavation areas, from the Adad Gate \u2013 now completely repaired (after removing hundreds of tons of debris from ISIL's destructions), explored and protected with a new roof \u2013 deep into the Nebi Yunus town. In a few areas a thick later stratigraphy was encountered, but the late 7th century BC stratum was reached everywhere (actually in two areas in the pre-Sennacherib lower town the excavations already exposed older strata, up to the 11th century BC until now, aiming in the future at exploring the first settlement therein). The site is greatly endangered with dumping of debris, illegal settlements and quarrying as the main threats.\nArchaeological remains.\nToday, Nineveh's location is marked by two large mounds, Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell \"Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus\" \"Prophet Jonah\", and the remains of the city walls (about in circumference). The Neo-Assyrian levels of Kuyunjiq have been extensively explored. The other mound, \"Nab\u012b Y\u016bnus\", has not been as extensively explored because there was an Arab Muslim shrine dedicated to that prophet on the site. On July 24, 2014, the Islamic State destroyed the shrine as part of a campaign to destroy religious sanctuaries it deemed \"un-Islamic\", but also to loot that site through tunneling.\nThe ruin mound of Kuyunjiq rises about above the surrounding plain of the ancient city. It is quite broad, measuring about . Its upper layers have been extensively excavated, and several Neo-Assyrian palaces and temples have been found there. A deep sounding by Max Mallowan revealed evidence of habitation as early as the 6th millennium BC. Today, there is little evidence of these old excavations other than weathered pits and earth piles. In 1990, the only Assyrian remains visible were those of the entry court and the first few chambers of the Palace of Sennacherib. Since that time, the palace chambers have received significant damage by looters. Portions of relief sculptures that were in the palace chambers in 1990 were seen on the antiquities market by 1996. Photographs of the chambers made in 2003 show that many of the fine relief sculptures there have been reduced to piles of rubble.\nTell Nebi Yunus is located about south of Kuyunjiq and is the secondary ruin mound at Nineveh. On the basis of texts of Sennacherib, the site has traditionally been identified as the \"armory\" of Nineveh, and a gate and pavements excavated by Iraqis in 1954 have been considered to be part of the \"armory\" complex. Excavations in 1990 revealed a monumental entryway consisting of a number of large inscribed orthostats and \"bull-man\" sculptures, some apparently unfinished.\nFollowing the liberation of Mosul, the tunnels under Tell Nebi Yunus were explored in 2018, in which a 3000-year-old palace was discovered, including a pair of reliefs, each showing a row of women, along with reliefs of \"lamassu\".\nCity wall and gates.\nThe ruins of Nineveh are surrounded by the remains of a massive stone and mudbrick wall dating from about 700\u00a0BC. About 12\u00a0km in length, the wall system consisted of an ashlar stone retaining wall about high surmounted by a mudbrick wall about high and thick. The stone retaining wall had projecting stone towers spaced about every . The stone wall and towers were topped by three-step merlons.\nFive of the gateways have been explored to some extent by archaeologists:\nThreats to the site.\nBy 2003, the site of Nineveh was exposed to decay of its reliefs by a lack of proper protective roofing, vandalism and looting holes dug into chamber floors. Future preservation is further compromised by the site's proximity to expanding suburbs.\nThe ailing Mosul Dam is a persistent threat to Nineveh as well as the city of Mosul. This is in no small part due to years of disrepair (in 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cited it as the most dangerous dam in the world), the cancellation of a second dam project in the 1980s to act as flood relief in case of failure, and occupation by ISIL in 2014 resulting in fleeing workers and stolen equipment. If the dam fails, the entire site could be under as much as 45 feet (14\u00a0m) of water.\nIn an October 2010 report titled \"Saving Our Vanishing Heritage\", Global Heritage Fund named Nineveh one of 12 sites most \"on the verge\" of irreparable destruction and loss, citing insufficient management, development pressures and looting as primary causes.\nBy far, the greatest threat to Nineveh has been purposeful human actions by ISIL, which first occupied the area in the mid-2010s. In early 2015, they announced their intention to destroy the walls of Nineveh if the Iraqis tried to liberate the city. They also threatened to destroy artifacts. On February 26 they destroyed several items and statues in the Mosul Museum and are believed to have plundered others to sell overseas. The items were mostly from the Assyrian exhibit, which ISIL declared blasphemous and idolatrous. There were 300 items remaining in the museum out of a total of 1,900, with the other 1,600 being taken to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad for security reasons prior to the 2014 Fall of Mosul. Some of the artifacts sold and/or destroyed were from Nineveh. Just a few days after the destruction of the museum pieces, ISIL terrorists demolished parts of three other major UNESCO world heritage sites, at Khorsabad, Nimrud, and Hatra.\nRogation of the Ninevites (Nineveh's Wish).\nAssyrians of the Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East and Saint Thomas Christians of the Syro-Malabar Church observe a fast called \"Ba'uta d-Ninwe\" (\u0712\u0725\u0718\u072c\u0710 \u0715\u0722\u071d\u0722\u0718\u0710) which means \"Nineveh's Prayer\". Copts and Ethiopian Orthodox also maintain this fast.\nPopular culture.\nThe English Romantic poet Edwin Atherstone wrote an epic \"The Fall of Nineveh\". The work tells of an uprising against its king Sardanapalus of all the nations that were dominated by the Assyrian Empire. He is a great criminal. He has had one hundred prisoners of war executed. After a long struggle the town is conquered by Median and Babylonian troops led by prince Arbaces and priest Belesis. The king sets his own palace on fire and dies inside together with all his concubines.\nAtherstone's friend, the artist John Martin, created a painting of the same name inspired by the poem. The English poet John Masefield's well-known, fanciful 1903 poem \"Cargoes\" mentions Nineveh in its first line. Nineveh is also mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's 1897 poem \"Recessional\" and in Arthur O'Shaughnessy's 1873 poem \"Ode\".\nThe 1962 Italian peplum film \"War Gods of Babylon\", is based on the sacking and fall of Nineveh by the combined rebel armies led by the Babylonians.\nIn \"\", Jonah, much like his biblical counterpart, must travel to Nineveh due to God\u2019s demands.\nIn the 1973 film \"The Exorcist\", Father Lankester Merrin was on an archeological dig near Nineveh prior to returning to the United States and leading the exorcism of Reagan MacNiel."}

Nazareth is known as \"the Arab capital of Israel\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian.\nFindings unearthed in the neighboring Qafzeh Cave show that the area around Nazareth was populated in the prehistoric period. Nazareth was a Jewish village during the Roman and Byzantine periods, and is described in the New Testament as the childhood home of Jesus. It became an important city during the Crusades after Tancred established it as the capital of the Principality of Galilee. The city declined under Mamluk rule, and following the Ottoman conquest, the city's Christian residents were expelled, only to return once Fakhr ad-D\u012bn II granted them permission to do so. In the 18th century, Zahir al-Umar transformed Nazareth into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. The city grew steadily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when European powers invested in the construction of churches, monasteries, educational and health facilities.\nSince late antiquity, Nazareth has been a center of Christian pilgrimage, with many shrines commemorating biblical events. The Church of the Annunciation is the considered one of the largest Christian sites of worship in the Middle East. It contains the Grotto of the Annunciation, where, according to Catholic tradition, angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and announced that she would conceive and bear Jesus. According to Greek Orthodox belief, the same event took place at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, also known as Church of Saint Gabriel. Other important churches in Nazareth include the Synagogue Church, St. Joseph's Church, the Mensa Christi Church, and the Basilica of Jesus the Adolescent.\nAs the largest Arab city in Israel, Nazareth is a today a cultural, political, religious, economic and commercial center of the Arab citizens of Israel, and became also a center of Arab and Palestinian nationalism.\nEtymology.\nHebrew.\nOne view holds that \"Nazareth\" is derived from one of the Hebrew words for 'branch', namely , , and alludes to the prophetic, messianic words in Book of Isaiah 11:1, 'from (Jesse's) roots a Branch () will bear fruit'. One view suggests this toponym might be an example of a tribal name used by resettling groups on their return from exile. Alternatively, the name may derive from the verb , , \"watch, guard, keep,\" and understood either in the sense of \"watchtower\" or \"guard place\", implying the early town was perched on or near the brow of the hill, or, in the passive sense as 'preserved, protected' in reference to its secluded position. The negative references to Nazareth in the Gospel of John suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town's name to prophecy.\nGreek \"Nazara\".\nAnother theory holds that the Greek form (), used in Matthew and Luke, may derive from an earlier Aramaic form of the name, or from another Semitic language form. If there were a \"tsade\" (\u05e6) in the original Semitic form, as in the later Hebrew forms, it would normally have been transcribed in Greek with a \"sigma\" (\u03c3) instead of a \"zeta\" (\u03b6). This has led some scholars to question whether \"Nazareth\" and its cognates in the New Testament actually refer to the settlement known traditionally as Nazareth in Lower Galilee. Such linguistic discrepancies may be explained, however, by \"a peculiarity of the 'Palestinian' Aramaic dialect wherein a sade (\u1e63) between two voiced (sonant) consonants tended to be partially assimilated by taking on a zayin (z) sound\".\nArabic \"an-N\u0101\u1e63ira\".\nThe Arabic name for Nazareth is \"an-N\u0101\u1e63ira\", and Jesus (, \"Yas\u016b`\") is also called \"an-N\u0101\u1e63ir\u012b\", reflecting the Arab tradition of according people an attribution, a name denoting whence a person comes in either geographical or tribal terms. In the Qur'an, Christians are referred to as \"na\u1e63\u0101r\u0101\", meaning \"followers of an-N\u0101\u1e63ir\u012b\", or \"those who follow Jesus of Nazareth\".\nNew Testament references.\nIn Luke's Gospel, Nazareth is first described as 'a town of Galilee' and home of Mary. Following the birth and early epiphanial events of chapter 2 of Luke's Gospel, Mary, Joseph and Jesus \"returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth\".\nThe phrase \"Jesus of Nazareth\" appears seventeen times in English translations of the New Testament, whereas the Greek original contains the form \"Jesus the \"Nazar\u0113nos\"\" or \"Jesus the \"Naz\u014draios\".\" One plausible view is that \"Naz\u014draean\" (\u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2) is a normal Greek adaptation of a reconstructed, hypothetical term in Jewish Aramaic for the word later used in Rabbinical sources to refer to Jesus. \"Nazar\u00e9th\" is named twelve times in surviving Greek manuscript versions of the New Testament, 10 times as \"Nazar\u00e9th\" or \"Nazar\u00e9t\", and twice as \"Nazar\u00e1\". The former two may retain the 'feminine' endings common in Galilean toponyms. The minor variants, \"Nazarat\" and \"Nazarath\" are also attested. \"Nazara\" (\u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac) might be the earliest form of the name in Greek, going back to the putative Q document. It is found in Matthew 4:13 and Luke 4:16. However, the Textus Receptus clearly translates all passages as \"Nazara\" leaving little room for debate there.\nMany scholars have questioned a link between \"Nazareth\" and the terms \"Nazarene\" and \"Nazoraean\" on linguistic grounds, while some affirm the possibility of etymological relation \"given the idiosyncrasies of Galilean Aramaic.\"\nExtrabiblical references.\nThe form \"Nazara\" is also found in the earliest non-scriptural reference to the town, a citation by Sextus Julius Africanus dated about AD 221 (see \"Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods\" below). The Church Father Origen (c. AD 185 to 254) knows the forms \"Nazar\u00e1\" and \"Nazar\u00e9t\". Later, Eusebius in his \"Onomasticon\" (translated by St. Jerome) also refers to the settlement as \"Nazara\". The \"na\u0219irutha\" of the scriptures of the Mandeans refers to \"priestly craft\", not to Nazareth, which they identified with Qom.\nThe first non-Christian reference to Nazareth is an inscription on a marble fragment from a synagogue found in Caesarea Maritima in 1962. This fragment gives the town's name in Hebrew as \u05e0\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea (n-\u1e63-r-t). The inscription dates to c. AD 300 and chronicles the assignment of priests that took place at some time after the Bar Kokhba revolt, AD 132\u201335. (See \"Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods\" below.) An 8th-century AD Hebrew inscription, which was the earliest known Hebrew reference to Nazareth prior to the discovery of the inscription above, uses the same form.\nNazarenes, Nasranis, \"Notzrim\", Christians.\nAround 331, Eusebius records that, from the name Nazareth, Christ was called a Nazoraean, and that, in earlier centuries, Christians were once called Nazarenes. Tertullian (Against Marcion 4:8) records that \"for this reason the Jews call us 'Nazarenes'.\" In the New Testament Christians are called \"Christians\" three times by Paul in Romans, and \"Nazarenes\" once by Tertullus, a Jewish lawyer. The Rabbinic and modern Hebrew name for Christians, \"notzrim,\" is also thought to derive from Nazareth, and be connected with Tertullus' charge against Paul of being a member of the sect of the Nazarenes, \"Nazoraioi\", \"men of Nazareth\" in Acts. Against this, some medieval Jewish polemical texts connect \"notzrim\" with the \"netsarim\" \"watchmen\" of Ephraim in Jeremiah 31:6. In Syriac Aramaic \"Nasrath\" (\u0722\u0728\u072a\u072c) is used for Nazareth, while \"Nazarenes\" (Acts 24:5) and \"of Nazareth\" are both \"Nasrani\" or \"Nasraya\" (\u0715\u0722\u0728\u072a\u071d\u0710) an adjectival form. \"Nasrani\" is used in the Quran for Christians, and in Modern Standard Arabic may refer more widely to Western people. Saint Thomas Christians, an ancient community of Jewish Christians in India who trace their origins to evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century, are sometimes known by the name \"Nasrani\" even today.\nHistory.\nStone Age.\nArchaeological researchers have revealed that a funerary and cult center at Kfar HaHoresh, about two miles () from current Nazareth, dates back roughly 9,000 years to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B era. The remains of some 65 individuals were found, buried under huge horizontal headstone structures, some of which consisted of up to 3 tons of locally produced white plaster. Decorated human skulls uncovered there have led archaeologists to identify Kfar HaHoresh as a major cult centre in that era.\nBronze and Iron Age.\nThe Franciscan priest Bellarmino Bagatti, \"Director of Christian Archaeology\", carried out extensive excavation of this \"Venerated Area\" from 1955 to 1965. Fr. Bagatti uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics, silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC) which indicated substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time.\nRoman period.\nArchaeological evidence shows the Nazareth was occupied during the late Hellenistic period, through the Roman period and into the Byzantine period.\nAccording to the Gospel of Luke, Nazareth was the home village of Mary as well as the site of the Annunciation (when the angel Gabriel informed Mary that she would give birth to Jesus). According to the Gospel of Matthew, Joseph and Mary resettled in Nazareth after returning from the flight from Bethlehem to Egypt. According to the Bible, Jesus grew up in Nazareth from some point in his childhood. However, some modern scholars also regard Nazareth as the birthplace of Jesus.\nA Hebrew inscription found in Caesarea dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century mentions Nazareth as the home of the priestly Hapizzez/Hafizaz family after the Bar Kokhba revolt (AD 132\u2013135). From the three fragments that have been found, the inscription seems to be a list of the twenty-four priestly courses, with each course (or family) assigned its proper order and the name of each town or village in Galilee where it settled. Nazareth is not spelled with the \"z\" sound but with the Hebrew tsade (thus \"Nasareth\" or \"Natsareth\"). Eleazar Kalir (a Hebrew Galilean poet variously dated from the 6th to 10th century) mentions a locality clearly in the Nazareth region bearing the name Nazareth \u05e0\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea (in this case vocalized \"Nitzrat\"), which was home to the descendants of the 18th Kohen family Happitzetz (\u05d4\u05e4\u05e6\u05e5), for at least several centuries after the Bar Kochva revolt.\nAlthough it is mentioned in the New Testament gospels, there are no extant non-biblical references to Nazareth until around AD 200, when Sextus Julius Africanus, cited by Eusebius (\"Church History\" 1.7.14), speaks of Nazara as a village in Judea and locates it near an as-yet unidentified \"Cochaba\". In the same passage Africanus writes of \"desposunoi\" \u2013 relatives of Jesus \u2013 who he claims \"kept the records of their descent with great care\". Ken Dark describes the view that Nazareth did not exist in Jesus's time as \"archaeologically unsupportable\".\nJames F. Strange, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, notes: \"Nazareth is not mentioned in ancient Jewish sources earlier than the third century AD. This likely reflects its lack of prominence both in Galilee and in Judaea.\" Strange originally calculated the population of Nazareth at the time of Christ as \"roughly 1,600 to 2,000 people\" but, in a subsequent publication that followed more than a decade of additional research, revised this figure down to \"a maximum of about 480.\" In 2009, Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre excavated archaeological remains in Nazareth that date to the time of Jesus in the early Roman period. Alexandre told reporters, \"The discovery is of the utmost importance since it reveals for the very first time a house from the Jewish village of Nazareth.\"\nOther sources state that during Jesus' time, Nazareth had a population of 400 and one public bath, which was important for civic and religious purposes, as a \"mikva\".\nA tablet at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris, dating to AD 50, was sent from Nazareth to Paris in 1878. It contains an inscription known as the \"Ordinance of Caesar\" that outlines the penalty of death for those who violate tombs or graves. However, it is suspected that this inscription came to Nazareth from somewhere else (possibly Sepphoris). Bagatti writes: \"we are not certain that it was found in Nazareth, even though it came from Nazareth to Paris. At Nazareth there lived various vendors of antiquities who got ancient material from several places.\" C. Kopp is more definite: \"It must be accepted with certainty that [the Ordinance of Caesar]\u2026 was brought to the Nazareth market by outside merchants.\" Princeton University archaeologist Jack Finnegan describes additional archaeological evidence related to settlement in the Nazareth basin during the Bronze and Iron Ages, and states that \"Nazareth was a strongly Jewish settlement in the Roman period.\"\nByzantine period.\nEpiphanius in his \"Panarion\" (c. AD 375) numbers Nazareth among the cities devoid of a non-Jewish population. Epiphanius, writing of Joseph of Tiberias, a wealthy Roman Jew who converted to Christianity in the time of Constantine, says he claimed to have received an imperial rescript to build Christian churches in Jewish towns and villages where no gentiles or Samaritans dwell, naming Tiberias, Diocaesarea, Sepphoris, Nazareth and Capernaum. From this scarce notice, it has been concluded that a small church which encompassed a cave complex might have been located in Nazareth in the early 4th century,\" although the town was Jewish until the 7th century.\nThe Christian monk and Bible translator Jerome, writing at the beginning of the 5th century, says Nazareth was a \"viculus\" or mere village.\nIn the 6th century, religious narrations from local Christians about the Virgin Mary began to spark interest in the site among pilgrims, who founded the first church at the location of the current Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation at the site of a freshwater spring, today known as Mary's Well. Around 570, the Anonymous of Piacenza reports travelling from Sepphoris to Nazareth. There he records seeing in the Jewish synagogue the books from which Jesus learnt his letters, and a bench where he sat. According to him, Christians could lift it, but Jews could not, since it disallowed them from dragging it outside. Writing of the beauty of the Hebrew women there, he records them saying St. Mary was a relative of theirs, and notes that, \"The house of St. Mary is a basilica.\" Constantine the Great ordered that churches be built in Jewish cities, and Nazareth was one of the places designated for this purpose, although construction of churches apparently only started decades after Constantine's death, i.e. after 352.\nArchaeologists have unearthed evidence that previous to the erection of the Byzantine-period church at the site of Mary's house in the mid-5th century, Judeo-Christians had built there a synagogue-church, leaving behind Judeo-Christian symbols. Until being expelled in c. 630, Jews probably kept on using their older synagogue, while the Judeo-Christian needed to build their own, probably at the site of Mary's house.\nThe Jewish town profited from the Christian pilgrim trade which began in the 4th century AD, but latent anti-Christian hostility broke out in AD 614 when the Persians invaded Palestine. The Christian Byzantine author Eutychius claimed that Jewish people of Nazareth helped the Persians carry out their slaughter of the Christians. When the Byzantine or Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius ejected the Persians in AD 629-630, he expelled the Jews from the village, turning it all-Christian.\nEarly Muslim period.\nThe Arab Muslim invasion of AD 638 had no immediate impact on the Christians of Nazareth and their churches, since Bishop Arculf remembered seeing there around 670 two churches, one at the house of Joseph where Jesus had lived as a child, and one at the house of Mary where she received the Annunciation - but no synagogue, which had possibly been transformed into a mosque. The 721 iconoclastic edict of Caliph Yazid II apparently led to the destruction of the former church, so that Willibald found during his pilgrimage in 724-26 only one church there, the one dedicated to St. Mary, which Christians had to save through repeated payments from destruction by the \"pagan Saracens\" (Muslim Arabs). The ruins of St. Joseph's remained untouched for a very long time, while the Church St. Mary is repeatedly mentioned throughout the following centuries, including by an Arab geographer in 943.\nCrusader period.\nIn 1099, the Crusader Tancred captured Galilee and established his capital in Nazareth. He was the ruler of the Principality of Galilee, which was established, at least in name, in 1099, as a vassal of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Later, in 1115, Nazareth was created as a seigneury within the principality. A Martin of Nazareth, who probably acted as viscount of Nazareth, is documented in 1115 and in 1130/1131. Nazareth was the original site of the Latin Patriarch, also established by Tancred. The ancient diocese of Scythopolis was relocated under the Archbishop of Nazareth, as one of the four archdioceses in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. When the town returned to Muslim control in 1187 following the victory of Saladin in the Battle of Hattin, the remaining Crusaders and European clergy were forced to leave town. Frederick II managed to negotiate safe passage for pilgrims from Acre in 1229, and in 1251, Louis IX, the king of France, attended mass in the grotto, accompanied by his wife.\nMamluk period.\nIn 1263, Baybars, the Mamluk Sultan, destroyed the Christian buildings in Nazareth and declared the site off-limits to Latin clergy, as part of his bid to drive out the remaining Crusaders from Palestine. While Arab Christian families continued to live in Nazareth, its status was reduced to that of a poor village. Pilgrims who visited the site in 1294 reported only a small church protecting the grotto. In the 14th century, Franciscan monks were permitted to return and live within the ruins of the basilica.\nOttoman period.\nIn 1584 the Franciscan monks were evicted again from the site of the ruined basilica. In 1620, Fakhr-al-Din II, a Druze emir who controlled this part of Ottoman Syria, permitted them to build a small church at the Grotto of the Annunciation. Pilgrimage tours to surrounding sacred sites were organised by the Franciscans, but the monks suffered harassment from surrounding Bedouin tribes who often kidnapped them for ransom.\nStability returned with the rule of Zahir al-Umar, a powerful Arab sheikh who ruled the Galilee, and later much of the Levantine coast and Palestine. He transformed Nazareth from a minor village into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. Nazareth played a strategic role in Zahir's sheikhdom because it allowed him to wield control over the agricultural areas of central Galilee. He ensured Nazareth's security for other reasons as well, among them strengthening ties with France by protecting the Christian community and protecting one of his wives who resided in Nazareth.\nZahir authorized the Franciscans to build a church in 1730. That structure stood until 1955, when it was demolished to make way for a larger building completed in 1967. He also permitted the Franciscans to purchase the Synagogue Church in 1741 and authorized the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel's Church in 1767. Zahir commissioned the construction of a government house known as the Seraya, which served as the city's municipal headquarters until 1991. His descendants\u2014known as the \"Dhawahri\"\u2014along with the Zu'bi, Fahum, and 'Onassah families later constituted Nazareth's traditional Muslim elite.\nNazareth's Christian community did not fare well under Zahir's Ottoman successor, Jazzar Pasha (r. 1776\u20131804), and friction increased between its Christians and Muslim peasants from the surrounding villages. Nazareth was temporarily captured by the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799, during his Syrian campaign. Napoleon visited the holy sites and considered appointing his general Jean-Andoche Junot as the duke of Nazareth. During the rule of Governor Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt (1830\u20131840) over much of Ottoman Syria, Nazareth was opened to European missionaries and traders. After the Ottomans regained control, European money continued to flow into Nazareth and new institutions were established. The Christians of Nazareth were protected during the massacres of 1860 by Aqil Agha, the Bedouin leader who exercised control over the Galilee between 1845 and 1870.\nKaloost Vartan, an Armenian from Istanbul, arrived in 1864 and established the first medical mission in Nazareth, the Scottish \"hospital on the hill\", or the Nazareth Hospital as it is known today, with sponsorship from the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society. The Ottoman Sultan, who favored the French, allowed them to establish an orphanage, the Society of Saint Francis de Sale. By the late 19th century, Nazareth was a town with a strong Arab Christian presence and a growing European community, where a number of communal projects were undertaken and new religious buildings were erected. In 1871 Christ Church, the city's only Anglican church, was completed under the leadership of the Rev John Zeller and consecrated by Bishop Samuel Gobat.\nIn the late 19th century and the first years of the 20th century, Nazareth prospered as it served the role of a market center for the dozens of rural Arab villages located within its vicinity. Local peasants would purchase supplies from Nazareth's many \"souks\" (open-air markets), which included separate \"souks\" for agricultural produce, metalwork, jewelry and leathers. In 1914, Nazareth consisted of eight quarters: 'Araq, Farah, Jami', Khanuq, Maidan, Mazazwa, Sharqiya and Shufani. There were nine churches, two monasteries, four convents, two mosques, four hospitals, four private schools, a public school, a police station, three orphanages, a hotel, three inns, a flour mill and eight \"souks\". The Ottomans lost control of Palestine, including Nazareth, to the Allied Powers during World War I. By then, Nazareth's importance declined significantly as most of the Arab villages in the Jezreel Valley had been replaced by newly established Jewish communities.\nBritish Mandate period.\nThe United Kingdom gained control of Palestine in 1917, the same year of the Balfour Declaration, which promised British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In the years preceding and following the declaration, Jewish immigration to Palestine had been increasing. Representatives of Nazareth opposed the Zionist movement, sending a delegation to the 1919 and issuing a letter of protest in 1920 that condemned the movement while also proclaiming solidarity with the Jews of Palestine. Politically, Nazareth was becoming further involved in the growing Palestinian nationalist movement. In 1922, a Muslim-Christian Association was established in the town, largely sponsored by the Muslim al-Zu'bi family. A consistent and effective united Palestinian Arab religious front proved difficult to establish and alternative organizations such as the Supreme Muslim Council's Organization of Muslim Youth and the National Muslim Association were established in Nazareth later in the 1920s. in 1922 there had been a small population of 58 Jews and Jewish families living in Nazareth.\nNazareth was relatively slow to modernize. While other towns already had wired electricity, Nazareth delayed its electrification until the 1930s and invested instead in improving its water supply system. This included adding two reservoirs at the northwestern hills and several new cisterns. By 1930, a church for the Baptist denomination, a municipal garden at Mary's Well and a police station based in Zahir al-Umar's Seraya had been established and the Muslim Sharqiya Quarter had expanded.\nIn the 1936\u20131939 Arab Revolt, Nazareth played a minor role, contributing two rebel commanders out of 281 rebel commanders active in the country. The two were Nazareth native and Christian Fu'ad Nassar and Nazareth resident and Indur native Tawfiq al-Ibrahim. The nearby villages of Saffuriya and al-Mujaydil played a more active military role, contributing nine commanders between them. The leaders of the revolt sought to use Nazareth as a staging ground to protest the British proposal to include the Galilee into a future Jewish state. On 26 September 1937, the British district commissioner of the Galilee, Lewis Yelland Andrews, was assassinated in Nazareth by local rebels.\nBy 1946, the municipal boundary of Nazareth had been enlarged and new neighborhoods, namely Maidan, Maslakh, Khanuq and Nimsawi, were established. New homes were established in existing quarters and the town still had an abundance of orchards and agricultural fields. Two cigarette factories, a tobacco store, two cinemas and a tile factory had been established, significantly boosting Nazareth's economy. A new police station was built on Nazareth's southernmost hill, while the police station in the Seray had been converted into Nazareth's municipal headquarters. Watchtowers were also erected on some of the hilltops around the town. Other new or expanded government offices included a headquarters for the district commissioner at the former Ottoman military barracks, and offices for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Survey and Settlement.\nNazareth was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. In the months leading up to the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the town became a refuge for Arab-Palestinians fleeing the urban centers of Tiberias, Haifa and Baysan before and during the Haganah's capture of those cities on 18 April, 22 April and 12 May 1948, respectively.\nIsraeli period.\n1948 War.\nNazareth itself was not a field of battle during the 1948 War, which began on 15 May, before the first truce on 11 June, although some of the villagers had joined the loosely organized peasant military and paramilitary forces, and troops from the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) had entered Nazareth on 9 July. The local defense of the town consisted of 200\u2013300 militiamen distributed along the hills surrounding the town. The defense in the southern and western hills collapsed after Israeli shelling, while resistance in the northern hills had to contend with an incoming Israeli armored unit. Not long after the Israelis began shelling the local militiamen, Nazareth's police chief raised a white flag over the town's police station.\nMost of the fighting around Nazareth occurred in its satellite villages, particularly in Saffuriya, whose residents put up resistance until largely dispersing following Israeli air raids on 15 July. During the ten days of fighting which occurred between the first and second truce, Nazareth capitulated to Israeli troops during Operation Dekel on 16 July, after little more than token resistance. By then, morale among local militiamen was low and most refused to fight alongside the ALA because of their perceived weakness in the face of Israel's perceived military superiority and the alleged maltreatment of Christian residents and clergy by ALA volunteers. The Muslim mayor of Nazareth, Yusef Fahum requested a halt to all resistance put up by Nazarenes to prevent the town's destruction.\nThe surrender of Nazareth was formalized in a written agreement, whereby the town's leaders agreed to cease hostilities in return for promises from the Israeli officers, including brigade commander Ben Dunkelman (the leader of the operation), that no harm would come to the civilians of the town. Soon after the signing of the agreement, Dunkelman received an order from the Israeli General Chaim Laskov to forcibly evacuate the city's Arabs. He refused, remarking that he was \u2018shocked and horrified\u2019 that he would be commanded to renege on the agreement he, and also Chaim Laskov, had just signed. Twelve hours after defying his superior, he was relieved of his post, but not before obtaining assurances that the security of Nazareth's population would be guaranteed. David Ben-Gurion backed his judgement up, fearing that expelling Christian Arabs might provoke an outcry throughout the Christian world. By the end of the war, Nazareth's population saw a large influx of refugees from major urban centers and rural villages in the Galilee.\n1950s\u20131960s.\nIn the first few years of its incorporation into Israel, Nazareth's affairs were dominated by the issues of land expropriation, internally displaced refugees and the hardships of martial law, which included curfews and travel restrictions. Efforts to resolve these issues were largely unsuccessful and led to frustration among the inhabitants, which in turn contributed to political agitation in the city. As the largest Arab town in Israel, Nazareth became a center of Arab and Palestinian nationalism, and because the Communist Party was the sole legal political group that took up many of the local Arab causes, it gained popularity in Nazareth. Arab political organization within Nazareth and Israel was largely stymied by the state until recent decades. Arab and Palestinian nationalist sentiment continue to influence Nazareth's political life.\nIn 1954, 1,200 dunams of Nazareth's land, which had been slated for future urban expansion by the municipality, was expropriated by state authorities for the construction of government offices and, in 1957, for the construction of the Jewish town of Nazareth Illit. The latter was built as a way for the state to counterbalance the Arab majority in the region. Knesset member Seif el-Din el-Zoubi, who represented Nazareth, actively opposed the Absentees' Property Law, which allowed state expropriation of land from Arab citizens who were not permitted to return to their original villages. Zoubi argued that the internally displaced refugees were not absentees as they were still living in the country as citizens and wanted to return to their homes. Israel offered compensation to these internal refugees, but most refused for fear of permanently relinquishing their right of return. Tensions between Nazareth's inhabitants and the state came to a head during a 1958 May Day rally where marchers demanded that refugees be allowed to return to their villages, an end to land expropriation, and self-determination for Palestinians. Several young protesters were arrested for throwing stones at security forces. Martial law ended in 1966.\nOn 5 January 1964, Pope Paul VI included Nazareth in the first ever papal visit to the Holy Land.\n1980s\u20132010s.\nAs of the early 1990s, no city plans drafted by Nazareth Municipality have been approved by the government (both the British Mandate and later Israel) since 1942. This has left many people in Nazareth who vote in the city's municipal elections and receive services from its municipality effectively outside of the city's jurisdiction. Such areas include the Sharqiya and Jabal el-Daula quarters which are in Nazareth Illit's jurisdiction and whose residents had to acquire building permits from the latter city. Similarly, the Bilal neighborhood of the Safafra Quarter is located within Reineh's jurisdiction. In 1993, the residents of Bilal became official residents of Reineh. Nazareth's municipal plans for expansion prior to the establishment of Nazareth Illit, were to the north and east, areas that the latter city now occupy. Arab satellite towns are closely located to the north, west and southwest. Thus, the remaining area within the city's municipal boundaries available for expansion were to the northwest and the south, where the topography restricted urban development. After lobbying the Knesset and the Interior Ministry, el-Zoubi was able to have areas to the northwest of the city annexed to the municipality.\nIn the 1980s, the government began attempts to merge the nearby village of Ilut with Nazareth, although this move was opposed by residents from both localities and the Nazareth Municipality. Ilut's residents were included as part of Nazareth's electorate in the 1983 and 1989 municipal elections, which Ilut's residents largely boycotted, and in the 1988 national elections. Ilut was designated by the Interior Ministry as a separate local council in 1991. The Israeli government has designated a Nazareth metropolitan area that includes the local councils of Yafa an-Naseriyye to the south, Reineh, Mashhad and Kafr Kanna to the north, Iksal and Nazareth Illit to the east and Migdal HaEmek to the west.\nAs the political center of Israel's Arab citizens, Nazareth is the scene of annual rallies held by the community including Land Day since March 1975 and May Day. There are also frequent demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause. During the First Intifada (1987\u20131993), May Day marchers vocally supported the Palestinian uprising. On 22 December 1987, riots broke out during a strike held in solidarity with the Intifada. On 24 January 1988, a mass demonstration attracted between 20,000\u201350,000 participants from Nazareth and other Arab towns. On 13 May, during a football match in Nahariya, a riot broke out between Arab and Jewish fans, resulting in a Jewish man being stabbed and 54 people, mostly Arabs, being arrested. A rally in Nazareth on 19 May followed, in which thousands of Arabs protested against \"racist attacks\" against the Arab fans and discriminatory policies against Arabs in general.\nPreparations for the Pope's visit to Nazareth in 2000 triggered highly publicized tensions related to the Basilica of the Annunciation. In 1997, permission was granted to construct a paved plaza to handle the thousands of Christian pilgrims expected to arrive. A small group of Muslims protested and occupied the site, where a nephew of Saladin, named Shihab al-Din, is believed to be buried. A school, al-Harbyeh, had been built on the site by the Ottomans, and the Shihab-Eddin shrine, along with several shops owned by the waqf, were located there. Government approval of plans for a large mosque on the property triggered protests from Christian leaders. In 2002, a special government commission permanently halted construction of the mosque.\nIn March 2006, public protests followed the disruption of a prayer service by an Israeli Jew and his Christian wife and daughter, who detonated firecrackers inside the church. The family said it wanted to draw attention to their problems with the welfare authorities. In July 2006 a rocket fired by Hezbollah as part of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict killed two children in Nazareth.\nIn March 2010, the Israeli government approved a $3 million plan to develop Nazareth's tourism industry. New businesses receive start-up grants of up to 30 percent of their initial investment from the Ministry of Tourism.\n2020s.\nRiots broke out in Nazareth during the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis.\nGeography.\nTwo locations for Nazareth are cited in ancient texts: the Galilean (northern) location in the Christian gospels and a southern (Judean) location mentioned in several early noncanonical texts.\nModern-day Nazareth is nestled in a natural bowl which reaches from 320 metres above sea level to the crest of the hills about 488 metres. Nazareth is about 25 kilometres from the Sea of Galilee and about 9 kilometres west from Mount Tabor. The major cities of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are situated approximately 146 kilometres and 108 kilometres respectively, away from Nazareth. The Nazareth Range, in which the town lies, is the southernmost of several parallel east\u2013west hill ranges that characterize the elevated tableau of Lower Galilee.\nClimate.\nNazareth has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Csa\").\nDemographics.\nNazareth is the largest Arab city in Israel. In 2009, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Nazareth's Arab population was 69% Muslim and 30.9% Christian. The greater Nazareth metropolitan area had a population of 210,000, including 125,000 Arabs (59%) and 85,000 Jews (41%). It is the only urban area with over 50,000 residents in Israel where the majority of the population is Arab. The greater Nazareth metropolitan area includes Nof HaGalil, Yafa an-Naseriyye, Reineh, Migdal HaEmek, Ein Mahil, Ilut, Kafr Kanna, Mashhad and Iksal.\nNazareth is home to the largest Arab Christian community in Israel, the Christian communities of Nazareth are varied and included various denominations, the most prominent among them the Greek Orthodox, Melkite Greek Catholic, Latin Catholics, Maronites, Armenian Orthodox, and Protestants. By far the largest among them is the Greek-Orthodox community, headed by a Patriarch based in Jerusalem, and represented in Nazareth by a Metropolite. The Christian communities in Nazareth tend to be wealthier and better educated compare to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel, and Christians of Nazareth occupay the majority of the top positions in the town: three hospitals and bank managers, judges and school principals and faculties. The socio-economic gap between the Christians wealth and Muslim poverty led sometimes to sectarian crises. \nMany of the descendants of the Zayadina clan in modern-day Israel use the surname 'al-Zawahirah' or 'Dhawahri' in honor of Zahir (whose name is colloquially transliterated as 'Dhaher'). They mostly live in the Galilee localities of Nazareth, Bi'ina, Kafr Manda, and, before its depopulation in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the village of Damun. \"Dhawahri\", made up one of the important families in Muslim community of Nazareth, beside the \"Fahoums\", the \"Zu'bis\", and the \"Onallas\".\nDemographic history.\nDuring the late Ottoman era, the religious majority of the city fluctuated. In 1838, there were 325 Christian families (half of whom were Greek Orthodox, the remainder belonged to various Catholic churches) and 120 Muslim families. In 1856, the population was estimated to be 4,350, of which Muslims comprised 52%, while Christians from various denominations comprised 48%. In 1862, the population estimate was lower (3,120) and Christians formed a substantial majority of over 78%. The population grew to 5,660 in 1867 and Christians constituted roughly two-thirds and Muslims one-third of the inhabitants. These estimates during the late Ottoman era likely represented crude figures.\nA population list from about 1887 showed that Nazareth had about 6,575 inhabitants; 1,620 Muslims, 2,485 Greek Catholics, 845 Catholics, 1,115 Latins, 220 Maronites and 290 Protestants.\nFor much of the British Mandatory period (1922\u20131948), Nazareth had a Christian majority (mostly Orthodox Christians) and a Muslim minority.\nIn 1918, Nazareth had an estimated population of 8,000, two-thirds Christian. In the 1922 British census, Nazareth's population was recorded as 7,424 residents, of which 66% were Christian, 33% were Muslim and roughly 1% were Jewish. In the 1931 census, the population grew to 8,756 and the ratio of Muslims increased to 37%. The largest Christian community were the Greek Orthodox denomination, followed by the Roman Catholics and the Melkites. Smaller communities of Anglicans, Maronites, Syriac Catholics, Protestants and Copts also existed.\nIn 1946, Nazareth had a population of 15,540, of whom roughly 60% were Christians and 40% were Muslims. The 1948 War led to an exodus of Palestinians and many expelled or fleeing Muslims from villages in the Galilee and the Haifa area found refuge in Nazareth. At one point, some 20,000 mostly Muslim internally displaced persons were present in the city. Following the war's conclusion, the internally displaced persons of Shefa-'Amr, Dabburiya, Ilut and Kafr Kanna returned to their homes. However, those Muslim and Christian internally displaced persons from the nearby destroyed villages of Ma'lul, al-Mujaydil, Saffuriya, the Haifa-area village of Balad al-Sheikh and the major cities of Acre, Haifa, Tiberias, Safad and Baysan remained as they were not able to return to their hometowns. During the war and in the following months, internally displaced persons from Saffuriya established the Safafra Quarter, named after their former village. Around 20% of Nazareth's native inhabitants left Palestine during the war. In an Israeli army census in July 1948, Nazareth had a total population of 17,118, which consisted of 12,640 Nazarenes and 4,478 internally displaced persons. In 1951, the population was recorded as 20,300, 25% of whom were internally displaced persons. The internally displaced persons came from over two dozen villages, but most were from al-Mujaydil, Saffuriya, Tiberias, Haifa, Ma'lul and Indur.\nToday, Nazareth still has a significant Christian population, made up of various denominations. The Muslim population has grown due to a number of historical factors that include the city having served as administrative center under British rule, and the influx of internally displaced Palestinian Arabs absorbed into the city from neighboring towns during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.\nEconomy.\nIn 2011, Nazareth had over 20 Arab-owned high-tech companies, mostly in the field of software development. According to the \"Haaretz\" newspaper the city has been called the \"Silicon Valley of the Arab community\" in view of its potential in this sphere.\nReligious sites.\nChristian.\nNazareth is home to dozens of monasteries and churches, many of them in the Old City.\nMuslim.\nMuslim holy sites include\nMuslim places of worship include\nArchaeology.\n\"Venerated area\" near the Basilica of the Annunciation.\nWhile excavations conducted prior to 1931 in the Franciscan \"venerated area\" (the side of the hill known as Jabal Nebi Sa'in, stretching north of the Basilica of the Annunciation) revealed no trace of a Greek or Roman settlement there, later digs under Fr. Bagatti, who acted as the principal archaeologist for the venerated sites in Nazareth, unearthed quantities of later Roman and Byzantine artifacts, attesting to unambiguous human presence there from the 2nd century AD onward. John Dominic Crossan, a noted New Testament scholar, remarked that Bagatti's archaeological drawings indicate just how small the village actually was, suggesting that it was little more than an insignificant hamlet.\nEarly Roman house.\nRemains of a residential house dating to the Early Roman period were discovered in 2009 next to the Basilica of the Annunciation and are on display in the \"International Marian Center of Nazareth\". According to the Israel Antiquities Authority, \"The artifacts recovered from inside the building were few and mostly included fragments of pottery vessels from the Early Roman period (the first and second centuries AD)... Another hewn pit, whose entrance was apparently camouflaged, was excavated and a few pottery sherds from the Early Roman period were found inside it.\" Archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre adds that \"based on other excavations that I conducted in other villages in the region, this pit was probably hewn as part of the preparations by the Jews to protect themselves during the Great Revolt against the Romans in 67 AD\".\nKokh tombs.\nNoteworthy is that all the post-Iron Age tombs in the Nazareth basin (approximately two dozen) are of the kokh (plural \"kokhim\") or later types; this type probably first appeared in Galilee in the middle of the 1st century AD. Kokh tombs in the Nazareth area have been excavated by B. Bagatti, N. Feig, Z. Yavor, and noted by Z. Gal.\nAncient bathhouse at Mary's Well.\nIn the mid-1990s, a shopkeeper discovered tunnels under his shop near Mary's Well in Nazareth. The tunnels were identified as the hypocaust of a bathhouse. Excavations in 1997\u201398 revealed remains dating from the Roman, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods.\nEducation.\nWith the near total depopulation of the Palestinian Arabs in the major cities of Haifa and Jaffa as a result of the 1948 war, Nazareth, Kafr Yasif and Rameh became one of a few towns in the newly-established state of Israel to emerge as a central space for Arab culture and politics. \nThree prestigious Arab Christian schools in Nazareth are the St. Joseph\u2019s Eclerical School, run by the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Nuns of St. Joseph School, a Catholic institution, and the Nazareth Baptist High School, a Protestant institution. About half of students in Nazareth attend Christian schools (10 schools) that found in the city. Christian schools in Nazareth are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools. These Arab Christian schools accommodate Christian students, Muslims, Druze from across the country.\nSports.\nThe city's main football club, Ahi Nazareth, currently plays in Liga Leumit, the second tier of Israeli football. The club spent two seasons in the top division, in 2003\u201304 and again in 2009\u201310. They are based at the Ilut Stadium in nearby Ilut. Other local clubs are Al-Nahda Nazareth, currently plays in Liga Bet, Beitar al-Amal Nazareth, Hapoel Bnei Nazareth and Hapoel al-Ittihad Nazareth all play in Liga Gimel.\nHospitals.\nThe city has three hospitals, run by the Christian community of Nazareth, and serving its districts:\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nNazareth is twinned with:"}
{"id": "21703", "revid": "1304678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21703", "title": "Noah", "text": "Noah () is the tenth and last of the pre-Flood patriarchs in the traditions of Abrahamic religions. His story appears in the Hebrew Bible (Book of Genesis, chapters 5\u20139), the Quran and Baha'i writings. Noah is referenced in various other books of the Bible, including the New Testament, and in associated deuterocanonical books.\nThe Genesis flood narrative is among the best-known stories of the Bible. In this account, Noah labored faithfully to build the Ark at God's command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the Flood. Afterwards, God made a covenant with Noah and promised never again to destroy all the Earth's creatures with a flood. Noah is also portrayed as a \"tiller of the soil\" and as a drinker of wine.\nBiblical narrative.\nTenth and final of the pre-Flood (antediluvian) Patriarchs, son to Lamech and an unnamed mother, Noah is 500 years old before his sons Shem, Ham and Japheth are born.\nGenesis flood narrative.\nThe Genesis flood narrative is encompassed within chapters 6\u20139 in the Book of Genesis, in the Bible. The narrative indicates that God intended to return the Earth to its pre-Creation state of watery chaos by flooding the Earth because of humanity's misdeeds and then remake it using the microcosm of Noah's ark. Thus, the flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of Creation. The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to destroy the world by way of the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals, Noah, and his family, and God's guarantee (the Noahic Covenant) for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood.\nAfter the flood.\nAfter the flood, Noah offered burnt offerings to God. God accepted the sacrifice, and made a covenant with Noah, and through him with all mankind, that he would not waste the earth or destroy man by another deluge.\n\"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth\". As a pledge of this gracious covenant with man and beast the rainbow was set in the clouds (ib. viii. 15\u201322, ix. 8\u201317). Two injunctions were laid upon Noah: While the eating of animal food was permitted, abstinence from blood was strictly enjoined; and the shedding of the blood of man by man was made a crime punishable by death at the hands of man (ib. ix. 3\u20136).\nNoah, as the last of the extremely long-lived Antediluvian patriarchs, died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950, when Terah was 128. The maximum human lifespan, as depicted by the Bible, gradually diminishes thereafter, from almost 1,000 years to the 120 years of Moses.\nNoah's drunkenness.\nAfter the flood, the Bible says that Noah became a farmer and he planted a vineyard. He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay \"uncovered\" within his tent. Noah's son Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his brothers, which led to Ham's son Canaan being cursed by Noah.\nAs early as the Classical era, commentators on Genesis 9:20\u201321 have excused Noah's excessive drinking because he was considered to be the first wine drinker; the first person to discover the effects of wine. John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, and a Church Father, wrote in the 4th century that Noah's behavior is defensible: as the first human to taste wine, he would not know its effects: \"Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink, fell into a drunken stupor\". Philo, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, also excused Noah by noting that one can drink in two different manners: (1) to drink wine in excess, a peculiar sin to the vicious evil man or (2) to partake of wine as the wise man, Noah being the latter. In Jewish tradition and rabbinic literature on Noah, rabbis blame Satan for the intoxicating properties of the wine.\nIn the context of Noah's drunkenness, relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\".\nBecause of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\". A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at Canaan for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah realised what had occurred. In the field of psychological biblical criticism, J. H. Ellens and W. G. Rollins have analysed the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham as revolving around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as Habakkuk 2:15 and Lamentations 4:21.\nOther commentaries mention that \"uncovering someone's nakedness\" could mean having sexual intercourse with that person or that person's spouse, as quoted in Leviticus 18:7\u20138 and 20. From this interpretation comes the speculation that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah or his own mother. The latter interpretation would clarify why Canaan, as the product of this illicit union, was cursed by Noah.&lt;ref name=\"Bergsma/Hahn\"&gt;John Sietze Bergsma/Scott Walker Hahn. 2005. \"Noah's Nakedness and the Curse on Canaan\". \"Journal Biblical Literature\" 124/1 (2005), p. 25-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Canaan could be the perpetrator himself as the Bible describes the illicit deed being committed by Noah's \"youngest son\", with Ham being consistently described as the middle son in other verses.\nTable of nations.\nGenesis 10 sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the Earth after the flood. Among Japheth's descendants were the maritime nations (10:2\u20135). Ham's son Cush had a son named Nimrod, who became the first man of might on earth, a mighty hunter, king in Babylon and the land of Shinar (10:6\u201310). From there Ashur went and built Nineveh. (10:11\u201312) Canaan's descendants Sidon, Heth, the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites spread out from Sidon as far as Gerar, near Gaza, and as far as Sodom and Gomorrah (10:15\u201319). Among Shem's descendants was Eber (10:21).\nThese genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11. It has a segmented or treelike structure, going from one father to many offspring. It is strange that the table, which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth, precedes the account of the Tower of Babel, which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed.\nFamily tree.\nGenesis 5:1-32 transmits a genealogy of the Sethites down to Noah, which is taken from the priestly tradition. \nA genealogy of the Canites from the Jawhistic tradition is found in Genesis 4:17\u201326.\nBiblical scholars see these as variants on one and the same list. However, if we take the merged text of Genesis as a single account, we can construct the following family tree, which has come down in this form into the Jewish and Christian traditions.\nNarrative analysis.\nAccording to the documentary hypothesis, the first five books of the Bible (Pentateuch/Torah), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC. Two of these, the Jahwist, composed in the 10th century BC, and the Priestly source, from the late 7th century BC, make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah. The attempt by the 5th-century editor to accommodate two independent and sometimes conflicting sources accounts for the confusion over such matters as how many of each animal Noah took, and how long the flood lasted.\n\"The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible\" notes that this story echoes parts of the Garden of Eden story: Noah is the first vintner, while Adam is the first farmer; both have problems with their produce; both stories involve nakedness; and both involve a division between brothers leading to a curse. However, after the flood, the stories differ. Noah plants the vineyard and utters the curse, not God, so \"God is less involved\".\nOther accounts.\nIn addition to the main story in Genesis, the Hebrew Bible (Christian Old Testament) also refers to Noah in the First Book of Chronicles, Isaiah and Ezekiel. References in the deuterocanonical books include the books of Tobit, Wisdom, Sirach, 2 Esdras and 4 Maccabees. New Testament references include the gospels of Matthew and Luke, and some of the epistles (Epistle to the Hebrews, 1 Peter and 2 Peter).\nNoah became the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including Islam (Surahs 71, 7, 11, 54, and 21 of the Quran) and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed faith (Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n and Gems of Divine Mysteries).\nPseudepigrapha.\nThe Book of Jubilees refers to Noah and says that he was taught the arts of healing by an angel so that his children could overcome \"the offspring of the Watchers\".\nIn 10:1\u20133 of the Book of Enoch (which is part of the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon) and canonical for Beta Israel, Uriel was dispatched by \"the Most High\" to inform Noah of the approaching \"deluge\".\nDead Sea scrolls.\nThere are 20 or so fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls that appear to refer to Noah. Lawrence Schiffman writes, \"Among the Dead Sea Scrolls at least three different versions of this legend are preserved.\" In particular, \"The Genesis Apocryphon devotes considerable space to Noah.\" However, \"The material seems to have little in common with Genesis 5 which reports the birth of Noah.\" Also, Noah's father is reported as worrying that his son was actually fathered by one of the Watchers.\nComparative mythology.\nIndian and Greek flood-myths also exist, although there is little evidence that they were derived from the Mesopotamian flood-myth that underlies the biblical account.\nMesopotamian.\nThe Noah story of the Pentateuch is quite similar to a flood story contained in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, composed c. 1800 BCE. In the Gilgamesh version, the Mesopotamian gods decide to send a great flood to destroy mankind. Various correlations between the stories of Noah and Gilgamesh (the flood, the construction of the ark, the salvation of animals, and the release of birds following the flood) have led to this story being seen as the source for the story of Noah. The few variations include the number of days of the deluge, the order of the birds, and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests. The flood story in Genesis 6\u20138 matches the Gilgamesh flood myth so closely that \"few doubt that [it] derives from a Mesopotamian account.\" What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale \"point by point and in the same order\", even when the story permits other alternatives.\nThe earliest written flood myth is found in the Mesopotamian Epic of Atrahasis and Epic of Gilgamesh texts. The \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" says \"These mythologies are the source of such features of the biblical Flood story as the building and provisioning of the ark, its flotation, and the subsidence of the waters, as well as the part played by the human protagonist.\" The \"Encyclopedia Judaica\" adds that there is a strong suggestion that \"an intermediate agent was active. The people most likely to have fulfilled this role are the Hurrians, whose territory included the city of Harran, where the Patriarch Abraham had his roots. The Hurrians inherited the Flood story from Babylonia\".\nThe encyclopedia mentions another similarity between the stories: Noah is the tenth patriarch and Berossus notes that \"the hero of the great flood was Babylonia\u2019s tenth antediluvian king.\" However, there is a discrepancy in the ages of the heroes. For the Mesopotamian antecedents, \"the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from 18,600 to nearly 65,000 years.\" In the Bible, the lifespans \"fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts.\" Also, the name of the hero differs between the traditions: \"The earliest Mesopotamian flood account, written in the Sumerian language, calls the deluge hero Ziusudra.\"\nHowever, Yi Samuel Chen writes that the oldest versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh never mentioned the flood, just mentioning that he went to talk to Utnapishtim to find the secret of immortality. Starting with the Old Babylonian Period, there were attempts to syncretize Utnapishtim with Ziusudra, even though they were previously seen as different figures. Gilgamesh meeting the flood hero was first alluded to in the Old Babylonian Period in \"The Death of Bilgamesh\" and eventually was imported and standardized in the Epic of Gilgamesh probably in the Middle Babylonian Period.\nGilgamesh\u2019s historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BC, shortly before the earliest known written stories. The discovery of artifacts associated with Aga and Enmebaragesi of Kish, two other kings named in the stories, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.\nThe earliest Sumerian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the Third dynasty of Ur (2100\u20132000 BC). One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh\u2019s journey to meet the flood hero, as well as a short version of the flood story, although Chen writes that his was included in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period. The earliest Akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to c. 2000\u20131500 BC. Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions, it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth; although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh\u2019s journey to meet Utnapishtim. The \"standard\" Akkadian version included a long version of the flood story and was edited by Sin-liqe-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC.\nYi Samuel Chen analyzes various texts from the Early Dynastic III Period through to the Old Babylonian Period, and argues that the flood narrative was only added in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period. When it comes to the Sumerian King List, observations by experts have always indicated that the portion of the Sumerian King List talking about before the flood is stylistically different from the King List Proper. Essentially Old Babylonian copies tend to represent a tradition of before the flood apart from the actual King List, whereas the Ur III copy of the King List and the duplicate from the Brockmon collection indicate that the King List Proper once existed independent of mention to the flood and the tradition of before the flood. Essentially, Chen gives evidence to prove that the section of before the flood and references to the flood in the Sumerian King List were all later additions added in during the Old Babylonian Period, as the Sumerian King List went through updates and edits. The Flood as a watershed in early History of the world was probably a new historiographical concept emerging in the Mesopotamian literary traditions during the Old Babylonian Period, as evident by the fact that the flood motif didn't show up in the Ur III copy and that earliest chronographical sources related to the flood show up in the Old Babylonian Period. Chen concludes that the name of Ziusudra as a flood hero and the idea of the flood hinted by that name in the Old Babylonian Version of \"Instructions of Shuruppak\" are only developments during that Old Babylonian Period, when also the didactic text was updated with information from the burgeoning Antediluvian Tradition\nAncient Greek.\nNoah has often been compared to Deucalion, the son of Prometheus and Pronoia in Greek mythology. Like Noah, Deucalion is warned of the flood (by Zeus and Poseidon); he builds an ark and staffs it with creatures \u2013 and when he completes his voyage, gives thanks and takes advice from the gods on how to repopulate the Earth. Deucalion also sends a pigeon to find out about the situation of the world and the bird returns with an olive branch. Deucalion, in some versions of the myth, also becomes the inventor of wine, like Noah. Philo and Justin equate Deucalion with Noah, and Josephus used the story of Deucalion as evidence that the flood actually occurred and that, therefore, Noah existed.\nThe motif of a weather deity who headed the pantheon causing the great flood and then the trickster who created men from clay saving man is also present in Sumerian Mythology, as Enlil, instead of Zeus, causes the flood, and Enki, rather than Prometheus, saves man. Stephanie West has written that this is perhaps due to the Greeks borrowing stories from the Near East.\nReligious views.\nJudaism.\nThe righteousness of Noah is the subject of much discussion among rabbis. The description of Noah as \"righteous in his generation\" implied to some that his perfection was only relative: In his generation of wicked people, he could be considered righteous, but in the generation of a \"tzadik\" like Abraham, he would not be considered so righteous. They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed, as Abraham prayed for the wicked of Sodom and Gomorrah. In fact, Noah is never seen to speak; he simply listens to God and acts on his orders. This led some commentators to offer the figure of Noah as \"the righteous man in a fur coat,\" who ensured his own comfort while ignoring his neighbour. Others, such as the medieval commentator Rashi, held on the contrary that the building of the Ark was stretched over 120 years, deliberately in order to give sinners time to repent. Rashi interprets his father's statement of the naming of Noah (in Hebrew \u2013 Noa\u0127 \u05e0\u05b9\u05d7\u05b7) \"This one will comfort us (in Hebrew\u2013 yeNa\u0126amenu \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05de\u05b5\u05e0\u05d5) in our work and in the toil of our hands, which come from the ground that the Lord had cursed\", by saying Noah heralded a new era of prosperity, when there was easing (in Hebrew \u2013 na\u0127ah \u2013 \u05e0\u05d7\u05d4) from the curse from the time of Adam when the Earth produced thorns and thistles even where men sowed wheat and that Noah then introduced the plow.\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", \"The Book of Genesis contains two accounts of Noah.\" In the first, Noah is the hero of the flood, and in the second, he is the father of mankind and a husbandman who planted the first vineyard. \"The disparity of character between these two narratives has caused some critics to insist that the subject of the latter account was not the same as the subject of the former.\"\nThe \"Encyclopedia Judaica\" notes that Noah's drunkenness is not presented as reprehensible behavior. Rather, \"It is clear that ... Noah\u2019s venture into viticulture provides the setting for the castigation of Israel\u2019s Canaanite neighbors.\" It was Ham who committed an offense when he viewed his father's nakedness. Yet, \"Noah\u2019s curse, ... is strangely aimed at Canaan rather than the disrespectful Ham.\"\nMandaeism.\nIn Mandaeism, Noah () is mentioned in of the \"Right Ginza\". In the text, Noah's wife is named as Nuraita (), while his son is named as Shum (i.e., Shem; ).\nChristianity.\nPeter 2:5 refers to Noah as a \"preacher of righteousness\". In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, Jesus compares Noah's flood with the coming Day of Judgement: \"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.\"\nThe First Epistle of Peter compares the power of baptism with the Ark saving those who were in it. In later Christian thought, the Ark came to be compared to the Church: salvation was to be found only within Christ and his Lordship, as in Noah's time it had been found only within the Ark. St Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430), demonstrated in \"The City of God\" that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which corresponds to the body of Christ; the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the Anglican rite of baptism, which asks God, \"who of thy great mercy didst save Noah,\" to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised.\nIn medieval Christianity, Noah's three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known continents, Japheth/Europe, Shem/Asia, and Ham/Africa, although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society \u2013 the priests (Shem), the warriors (Japheth), and the peasants (Ham). In medieval Christian thought, Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the people of black Africa. So, in racialist arguments, the curse of Ham became a justification for the slavery of the black races.\nIsaac Newton, in his religious works on the development of religion, wrote about Noah and his offspring. In Newton's view, while Noah was a monotheist, the gods of pagan antiquity are identified with Noah and his descendants.\nGnosticism.\nAn important Gnostic text, the \"Apocryphon of John\", reports that the chief archon caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made, but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon's plans, and Noah informed the remainder of humanity. Unlike the account of Genesis, not only are Noah's family saved, but many others also heed Noah's call. There is no ark in this account. According to Elaine Pagels, \"Rather, they hid in a particular place, not only Noah, but also many other people from the unshakable race. They entered that place and hid in a bright cloud.\"\nDruze faith.\nThe Druze regard Noah as the second spokesman (\"natiq\") after Adam, who helped transmit the foundational teachings of monotheism (\"tawhid\") intended for the larger audience. He is considered an important prophet of God among Druze, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history.\nIslam.\nNoah is a highly important figure in Islam and he is seen as one of the most significant of all prophets. The Quran contains 43 references to Noah, or \"Nu\u1e25\", in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, \"S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25\" (), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the Deluge. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a covenant with Noah just as he did with Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an Ark, after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop Mount Judi ().\nAlso, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.\n states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic. In Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed belief, only Noah's followers were spiritually alive, preserved in the ark of his teachings, as others were spiritually dead. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scripture \"Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n\" endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had a large number of companions, either 40 or 72, besides his family on the Ark, and that he taught for 950 (symbolic) years before the flood.\nAhmadiyya.\nAccording to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his dispensation, which extended until the time of Ibrahim (Abraham, 950 years). The first 50 years were the years of spiritual progress, which were followed by 900 years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah."}
{"id": "21704", "revid": "1666642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21704", "title": "Norwegian language", "text": "Norwegian ( ) is a North Germanic language spoken mainly in Norway, where it is an official language. Along with Swedish and Danish, Norwegian forms a dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible local and regional varieties; some Norwegian and Swedish dialects, in particular, are very close. These Scandinavian languages, together with Faroese and Icelandic as well as some extinct languages, constitute the North Germanic languages. Faroese and Icelandic are not mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them. While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers, English and German, have close similarities with Norwegian, neither is mutually intelligible with it. Norwegian is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Age.\nToday there are two official forms of \"written\" Norwegian, (literally 'book tongue') and (literally 'new Norwegian'), each with its own variants. developed from the Dano-Norwegian language that replaced Middle Norwegian as the elite language after the union of Denmark\u2013Norway in the 16th and 17th centuries and then evolved in Norway, while was developed based upon a collective of spoken Norwegian dialects. Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway, along with S\u00e1mi, a Finno-Ugric language spoken by less than one percent of the population. Norwegian is one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries who speak Norwegian have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any interpretation or translation costs.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nLike most of the languages in Europe, the Norwegian language descends from the Proto-Indo-European language. As early Indo-Europeans spread across Europe, they became isolated and new languages were developed. In the northwest of Europe, the West Germanic languages evolved, which would eventually become English, Dutch, German, and the North Germanic languages, of which Norwegian is one.\nProto-Norse is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic during the first centuries AD in what is today Southern Sweden. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions, the oldest form of the runic alphabets. A number of inscriptions are memorials to the dead, while others are magical in content. The oldest are carved on loose objects, while later ones are chiseled in runestones. They are the oldest written record of any Germanic language.\nAround 800 AD, the script was simplified to the Younger Futhark, and inscriptions became more abundant. At the same time, the beginning of the Viking Age led to the spread of Old Norse to Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. Viking colonies also existed in parts of the British Isles, France (Normandy), North America, and Kievan Rus. In all of these places except Iceland and the Faroes, Old Norse speakers went extinct or were absorbed into the local population.\nThe Roman alphabet.\nAround 1030, Christianity came to Scandinavia, bringing with it an influx of Latin borrowings and the Roman alphabet. These new words were related to church practices and ceremonies, although many other loanwords related to general culture also entered the language.\nThe Scandinavian languages at this time are not considered to be separate languages, although there were minor differences among what are customarily called Old Icelandic, Old Norwegian, Old Gutnish, Old Danish, and Old Swedish.\nLow German influence.\nThe economic and political dominance of the Hanseatic League between 1250 and 1450 in the main Scandinavian cities brought large Middle Low German\u2013speaking populations to Norway. The influence of their language on Scandinavian is similar to that of French on English after the Norman conquest.\nDano-Norwegian.\nIn the late Middle Ages, dialects began to develop in Scandinavia because the population was rural and little travel occurred. When the Reformation came from Germany, Martin Luther's High German translation of the Bible was quickly translated into Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic. Norway entered a union with Denmark in 1397 and Danish, over time, replaced Middle Norwegian as the language of the elite, the church, literature, and the law. When the union with Denmark ended in 1814, the Dano-Norwegian \"koin\u00e9\" had become the mother tongue of around 1% of the population.\nDanish to Norwegian.\nFrom the 1840s, some writers experimented with a Norwegianised Danish by incorporating words that were descriptive of Norwegian scenery and folk life, and adopting a more Norwegian syntax. Knud Knudsen proposed to change spelling and inflection in accordance with the Dano-Norwegian \"koin\u00e9\", known as \"cultivated everyday speech.\" A small adjustment in this direction was implemented in the first official reform of the Danish language in Norway in 1862 and more extensively after his death in two official reforms in 1907 and 1917.\nMeanwhile, a nationalistic movement strove for the development of a new written Norwegian. Ivar Aasen, a botanist and self-taught linguist, began his work to create a new Norwegian language at the age of 22. He traveled around the country collecting words and examples of grammar from the dialects and comparing the dialects among the different regions. He examined the development of Icelandic, which had largely escaped the influences under which Norwegian had come. He called his work, which was published in several books from 1848 to 1873, Landsm\u00e5l, meaning 'national language'. The name \"Landsm\u00e5l\" is sometimes interpreted as 'rural language' or 'country language', but this was clearly not Aasen's intended meaning.\nThe name of the Danish language in Norway was a topic of hot dispute throughout the 19th century. Its proponents claimed that it was a language common to Norway and Denmark, and no more Danish than Norwegian. The proponents of Landsm\u00e5l thought that the Danish character of the language should not be concealed. In 1899, Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson proposed the neutral name \"Riksm\u00e5l\", meaning 'national language' like \"Landsm\u00e5l\", and this was officially adopted along with the 1907 spelling reform. The name \"Riksm\u00e5l\" is sometimes interpreted as 'state language', but this meaning is secondary at best. (Compare to Danish \"rigsm\u00e5l\" from where the name was borrowed.)\nAfter the personal union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, both languages were developed further and reached what is now considered their classic forms after a reform in 1917. Riksm\u00e5l was, in 1929, officially renamed \"Bokm\u00e5l\" (literally 'book language'), and Landsm\u00e5l to \"Nynorsk\" (literally 'new Norwegian'). A proposition to substitute Danish-Norwegian () for \"Bokm\u00e5l\" lost in parliament by a single vote. The name \"Nynorsk\", the linguistic term for modern Norwegian, was chosen to contrast with Danish and emphasis on the historical connection to Old Norwegian. Today, this meaning is often lost, and it is commonly mistaken as a \"new\" Norwegian in contrast to the \"real\" Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l.\nBokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. This was a result of a state policy to merge Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l into a single language, to be called \"Samnorsk\". A 1946 poll showed that this policy was supported by 79% of Norwegians at the time. However, opponents of the official policy still managed to create a massive protest movement against \"Samnorsk\" in the 1950s, fighting in particular the use of \"radical\" forms in Bokm\u00e5l text books in schools. In the reform in 1959, the 1938 reform was partially reversed in Bokm\u00e5l, but Nynorsk was changed further towards Bokm\u00e5l. Since then Bokm\u00e5l has reverted even further toward traditional Riksm\u00e5l, while Nynorsk still adheres to the 1959 standard. Therefore, a small minority of Nynorsk enthusiasts use a more conservative standard called H\u00f8gnorsk. The Samnorsk policy had little influence after 1960, and was officially abandoned in 2002.\nPhonology.\nWhile the sound systems of Norwegian and Swedish are similar, considerable variation exists among the dialects.\nConsonants.\nThe retroflex consonants only appear in East Norwegian dialects as a result of sandhi, combining with , , , , and .\nThe realization of the rhotic depends on the dialect. In Eastern, Central, and Northern Norwegian dialects, it is a tap , whereas in Western and Southern Norway, and for some speakers also in Eastern Norway, it is uvular or . And in the dialects of North-Western Norway, it is realized as , much like the trilled of Spanish.\nAccent.\nNorwegian is a pitch-accent language with two distinct pitch patterns, like Swedish. They are used to differentiate two-syllable words with otherwise identical pronunciation. For example, in many East Norwegian dialects, the word ('farmers') is pronounced using the simpler tone 1, while ('beans' or 'prayers') uses the more complex tone 2. Though spelling differences occasionally differentiate written words, in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike, since written Norwegian has no explicit accent marks. In most eastern low-tone dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of intonational nature (phrase accent)\u2014the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis or focus, and corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack lexical tone, such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the utterance-final fall common in most languages is either very small or absent.\nThere are significant variations in pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The pitch accents (as well as the peculiar phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a \"singing\" quality that makes it easy to distinguish from other languages. Accent 1 generally occurs in words that were monosyllabic in Old Norse, and accent 2 in words that were polysyllabic.\nWritten language.\nAlphabet.\nThe Norwegian alphabet has 29 letters.\nThe letters \"c\", \"q\", \"w\", \"x\" and \"z\" are only used in loanwords. As loanwords are assimilated into Norwegian, their spelling might change to reflect Norwegian pronunciation and the principles of Norwegian orthography, e.g. \"zebra\" in Norwegian is written . Due to historical reasons, some otherwise Norwegian family names are also written using these letters.\nSome letters may be modified by diacritics: \"\u00e9\", \"\u00e8\", \"\u00ea\", \"\u00f3\", \"\u00f2\", and \"\u00f4\". In Nynorsk, \"\u00ec\" and \"\u00f9\" and \"\u1ef3\" are occasionally seen as well. The diacritics are not compulsory, but may in a few cases distinguish between different meanings of the word, e.g.: ('for/to'), ('went'), ('furrow') and ('fodder'). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably \"\u00fc\", \"\u00e1\" and \"\u00e0\".\nBokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\nAs established by law and government policy, the two official forms of \"written\" Norwegian are \"Bokm\u00e5l\" (literally 'book tongue') and \"Nynorsk\" ('new Norwegian'). The official Norwegian Language Council () is responsible for regulating the two forms, and recommends the terms \"Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l\" and \"Norwegian Nynorsk\" in English. Two other written forms without official status also exist. One, called \"Riksm\u00e5l\" ('national language'), is today to a large extent the same language as Bokm\u00e5l though somewhat closer to the Danish language. It is regulated by the unofficial Norwegian Academy, which translates the name as 'Standard Norwegian'. The other is \"H\u00f8gnorsk\" ('High Norwegian'), a more purist form of Nynorsk, which maintains the language in an original form as given by Ivar Aasen and rejects most of the reforms from the 20th century; this form has limited use.\nNynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l provide standards for how to write Norwegian, but not for how to speak the language. No standard of spoken Norwegian is officially sanctioned, and most Norwegians speak their own dialects in all circumstances. Thus, unlike in many other countries, the use of any Norwegian dialect, whether it coincides with the written norms or not, is accepted as correct \"spoken\" Norwegian. However, in areas where East Norwegian dialects are used, a tendency exists to accept a de facto spoken standard for this particular regional dialect, Urban East Norwegian or Standard East Norwegian (), in which the vocabulary coincides with Bokm\u00e5l. Outside Eastern Norway, this spoken variation is not used.\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, Danish was the standard written language of Norway. As a result, the development of modern written Norwegian has been subject to strong controversy related to nationalism, rural versus urban discourse, and Norway's literary history. Historically, Bokm\u00e5l is a Norwegianised variety of Danish, while Nynorsk is a language form based on Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to Danish. The now-abandoned official policy to merge Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk into one common language called \"Samnorsk\" through a series of spelling reforms has created a wide spectrum of varieties of both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk. The unofficial form known as \"Riksm\u00e5l\" is considered more conservative than Bokm\u00e5l and is far closer to Danish while the unofficial \"H\u00f8gnorsk\" is more conservative than Nynorsk and is far closer to Faroese, Icelandic and Old Norse.\nNorwegians are educated in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk. Each student gets assigned a native form based on which school they go to, whence the other form (known as ) will be a mandatory school subject from elementary school through high school. For instance, a Norwegian whose main language form is Bokm\u00e5l will study Nynorsk as a mandatory subject throughout both elementary and high school. A 2005 poll indicates that 86.3% use primarily Bokm\u00e5l as their daily written language, 5.5% use both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, and 7.5% use primarily Nynorsk. Thus, 13% are frequently \"writing\" Nynorsk, though the majority \"speak\" dialects that resemble Nynorsk more closely than Bokm\u00e5l. Broadly speaking, Nynorsk writing is widespread in western Norway, though not in major urban areas, and also in the upper parts of mountain valleys in the southern and eastern parts of Norway. Examples are Setesdal, the western part of Telemark county () and several municipalities in Hallingdal, Valdres, and Gudbrandsdalen. It is little used elsewhere, but 30\u201340 years ago, it also had strongholds in many rural parts of Tr\u00f8ndelag (mid-Norway) and the southern part of northern Norway (Nordland county). Today, Nynorsk is the official language of not only four of the nineteen Norwegian counties but also various municipalities in five other counties. NRK, the Norwegian broadcasting corporation, broadcasts in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, and all governmental agencies are required to support both written languages. Bokm\u00e5l is used in 92% of all written publications, and Nynorsk in 8% (2000).\nLike some other European countries, Norway has an official \"advisory board\" Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det (Norwegian Language Council) that determines, after approval from the Ministry of Culture, official spelling, grammar, and vocabulary for the Norwegian language. The board's work has been subject to considerable controversy throughout the years.\nBoth Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l have a great variety of optional forms. The Bokm\u00e5l that uses the forms that are close to Riksm\u00e5l is called \"moderate\" or \"conservative\", depending on one's viewpoint, while the Bokm\u00e5l that uses the forms that are close to Nynorsk is called \"radical\". Nynorsk has forms that are close to the original Landsm\u00e5l and forms that are close to Bokm\u00e5l.\nRiksm\u00e5l.\nOpponents of the spelling reforms aimed at bringing Bokm\u00e5l closer to Nynorsk have retained the name Riksm\u00e5l and employ spelling and grammar that predate the Samnorsk movement. Riksm\u00e5l and conservative versions of Bokm\u00e5l have been the \"de facto\" standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century, being used by large newspapers, encyclopedias, and a significant proportion of the population of the capital Oslo, surrounding areas, and other urban areas, as well as much of the literary tradition. Since the reforms of 1981 and 2003 (effective in 2005), the official Bokm\u00e5l can be adapted to be almost identical with modern Riksm\u00e5l. The differences between written Riksm\u00e5l and Bokm\u00e5l are comparable to American and British English differences.\nRiksm\u00e5l is regulated by the Norwegian Academy, which determines acceptable spelling, grammar, and vocabulary.\nH\u00f8gnorsk.\nThere is also an unofficial form of Nynorsk, called \"H\u00f8gnorsk\", discarding the post-1917 reforms, and thus close to Ivar Aasen's original Landsm\u00e5l. It is supported by Ivar Aasen-sambandet, but has found no widespread use.\nCurrent usage.\nIn 2010, 86.5% of the pupils in the primary and lower secondary schools in Norway receive education in Bokm\u00e5l, while 13.0% receive education in Nynorsk. From the eighth grade onwards, pupils are required to learn both. Out of the 431 municipalities in Norway, 161 have declared that they wish to communicate with the central authorities in Bokm\u00e5l, 116 (representing 12% of the population) in Nynorsk, while 156 are neutral. Of 4,549 state publications in 2000, 8% were in Nynorsk, and 92% in Bokm\u00e5l. The large national newspapers (\"Aftenposten\", \"Dagbladet\", and \"VG\") are published in Bokm\u00e5l or Riksm\u00e5l. Some major regional newspapers (including \"Bergens Tidende\" and \"Stavanger Aftenblad\"), many political journals, and many local newspapers use both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\nA newer trend is to write in dialect for informal use. When writing an SMS, Facebook update, or fridge note, most younger people write the way they talk rather than using Bokm\u00e5l or Nynorsk.\nDialects.\nThere is general agreement that a wide range of differences makes it difficult to estimate the number of different Norwegian dialects. Variations in grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation cut across geographical boundaries and can create a distinct dialect at the level of farm clusters. Dialects are in some cases so dissimilar as to be unintelligible to unfamiliar listeners. Many linguists note a trend toward regionalization of dialects that diminishes the differences at such local levels; there is, however, a renewed interest in preserving dialects.\nExamples.\nBelow are a few sentences giving an indication of the differences between Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, compared to the conservative (closer to Danish) form Riksm\u00e5l, Danish, as well as Old Norse, Swedish, Faroese, Icelandic (the living language grammatically closest to Old Norse), Old English and some modern West Germanic languages:\nGrammar.\nNouns.\nNorwegian nouns are inflected for number (singular/plural) and for definiteness (indefinite/definite). In a few dialects, definite nouns are also inflected for the dative case.\nNorwegian nouns belong to three noun classes (genders): masculine, feminine and neuter. All feminine nouns can optionally be inflected using masculine noun class morphology in Bokm\u00e5l due to its Danish heritage. In comparison, the use of all three genders (including the feminine) is mandatory in Nynorsk.\nAll Norwegian dialects have traditionally retained all the three grammatical genders from Old Norse to some extent. The only exceptions are the dialect of Bergen and a few upper class sociolects at the west end of Oslo that have completely lost the feminine gender.\nAccording to Marit Westergaard, approximately 80% of nouns in Norwegian are masculine.\nNorwegian and other Scandinavian languages use a suffix to indicate definiteness of a noun, unlike English which has a separate article, \"the\", to indicate the same.\nIn general, almost all nouns in Bokm\u00e5l follow these patterns (like the words in the examples above):\nIn contrast, almost all nouns in Nynorsk follow these patterns (the noun gender system is more pronounced than in Bokm\u00e5l):\nThere is in general no way to infer what grammatical gender a specific noun has, but there are some patterns of nouns where the gender can be inferred. For instance, all nouns ending in -\"nad\" will be masculine in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk (for instance the noun , which means 'job application'). Most nouns ending in -\"ing\" will be feminine, like the noun ('expectation').\nThere are some common irregular nouns, many of which are irregular in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, like the following:\nIn Nynorsk, even though the irregular word is masculine, it is inflected like a feminine word in the plural. Another word with the same irregular inflection is ('son \u2013 sons').\nIn Nynorsk, nouns ending in -\"ing\" typically have masculine plural inflections, like the word in the following table. But they are treated as feminine nouns in every other way.\nGenitive of nouns.\nIn general, the genitive case has died out in modern Norwegian and there are only some remnants of it in certain expressions: ('to the mountains'), ('to the sea'). To show ownership, there is an enclitic -\"s\" similar to English -\"s\"; ('Sondre's nice car', \"Sondre\" being a personal name). There are also reflexive possessive pronouns, , , , ; ('It is Sondre's'). In both Bokm\u00e5l and modern Nynorsk, there is often a mix of both of these to mark possession, though it is more common in Nynorsk to use the reflexive pronouns; in Nynorsk use of the reflexive possessive pronouns is generally encouraged to avoid mixing the enclitic -\"s\" with the historical grammatical case remnants of the language. The reflexive pronouns agree in gender and number with the noun.\nThe enclitic -\"s\" in Norwegian evolved as a shorthand expression for the possessive pronouns , , and .\nAdjectives.\nNorwegian adjectives, like those of Swedish and Danish, inflect for definiteness, gender, number and for comparison (affirmative/comparative/superlative). Inflection for definiteness follows two paradigms, called \"weak\" and \"strong\", a feature shared among the Germanic languages.\nThe following table summarizes the inflection of adjectives in Norwegian. The indefinite affirmative inflection can vary between adjectives, but in general the paradigm illustrated below is the most common. \nPredicate adjectives follow only the indefinite inflection table. Unlike attributive adjectives, they are not inflected for definiteness. \nIn most dialects, some verb participles used as adjectives have a separate form in both definite and plural uses, and sometimes also in the masculine-feminine singular. In some Southwestern dialects, the definite adjective is also declined in gender and number with one form for feminine and plural, and one form for masculine and neuter.\nAttributive adjectives.\nDefinite inflection.\nIn Norwegian, a definite noun has a suffixed definite article (cf. above) compared to English which in general uses the separate word \"the\" to indicate the same. However, when a definite noun is preceded by an adjective, the adjective also gets a definite inflection, shown in the inflection table above. There is also another definite marker, , that has to agree in gender with the noun when the definite noun is accompanied by an adjective. It comes before the adjective and has the following forms\nExamples of definite affirmative inflection of adjectives (Bokm\u00e5l):\nIf the adjective is dropped completely, the meaning of the preceding article before the noun changes, as shown in this example.\nExamples (Bokm\u00e5l):\nExamples of definite comparative and superlative inflection of adjectives (Bokm\u00e5l):\nDefiniteness is also signaled by using possessive pronouns or any uses of a noun in its genitive form in either Nynorsk or Bokm\u00e5l: ('my green house'), ('my green car'), ('my receding gums'), ('the president's old house').\nIndefinite inflection.\nExamples (Bokm\u00e5l):\nExamples of comparative and superlative inflections in Bokm\u00e5l: ('a greener car'), ('greenest car').\nPredicative adjectives.\nThere is also predicative agreement of adjectives in all dialects of Norwegian and in the written languages, unlike related languages like German and Dutch. This feature of predicative agreement is shared among the Scandinavian languages. Predicative adjectives do not inflect for definiteness unlike the attributive adjectives.\nThis means that nouns will have to agree with the adjective when there is a copula verb involved, like in Bokm\u00e5l: ('to be'), ('become'), ('looks like'), ('feels like') etc. \nVerbs.\nNorwegian verbs are not conjugated for person or number unlike English and most European languages, though a few Norwegian dialects do conjugate for number. Norwegian verbs are conjugated according to mainly three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and subjunctive, though the subjunctive mood has largely fallen out of use and is mainly found in a few common frozen expressions. The imperative is formed by removing the last vowel of the infinitive verb form, just like in the other Scandinavian languages.\nIndicative verbs are conjugated for tense: present, past, and future. The present and past tense also have a passive form for the infinitive.\nThere are four non-finite verb forms: infinitive, passive infinitive, and the two participles: perfective/past participle and imperfective/present participle.\nThe participles are verbal adjectives. The imperfective participle is not declined, whereas the perfect participle is declined for gender (though not in Bokm\u00e5l) and number like strong, affirmative adjectives. The definite form of the participle is identical to the plural form.\nAs with other Germanic languages, Norwegian verbs can be divided into two conjugation classes; weak verbs and strong verbs.\nErgative verbs.\nThere are ergative verbs in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, where there are two different conjugation patterns depending on if the verb takes an object or not. In Bokm\u00e5l, there are only two different conjugations for the preterite tense for the strong verbs, while Nynorsk has different conjugations for all tenses, like Swedish and a majority of Norwegian dialects. Some weak verbs are also ergative and are differentiated for all tenses in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, like , both of which meaning 'to lie down', but does not take an object while requires an object. corresponds to the English verb 'lay', while corresponds to the English verb 'lie'. There are, however, many verbs that do not have a direct translation to English verbs.\nPronouns.\nNorwegian personal pronouns are declined according to case: nominative and accusative. Like English, pronouns in Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk are the only class that has case declension. Some of the dialects that have preserved the dative in nouns, also have a dative case instead of the accusative case in personal pronouns, while others have accusative in pronouns and dative in nouns, effectively giving these dialects three distinct cases.\nIn the most comprehensive Norwegian grammar, Norsk referansegrammatikk, the categorization of personal pronouns by person, gender, and number is not regarded as inflection. Pronouns are a closed class in Norwegian.\nSince December 2017, the gender-neutral pronoun is present in the Norwegian Academy's dictionary (NAOB). In June 2022, the Language Council of Norway (Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det) started including in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk Norwegian standards.\nThe words for 'mine', 'yours' etc. are dependent on the gender of the noun described. Like adjectives, they have to agree in gender with the noun.\nBokm\u00e5l has two sets of third-person pronouns. and refer to male and female individuals respectively; and refer to impersonal or inanimate nouns, of masculine/feminine or neutral gender respectively. In contrast, Nynorsk and most dialects use the same set of pronouns ('he'), ('she') and ('it') for both personal and impersonal references, like in German, Icelandic and Old Norse. also has expletive and cataphoric uses like in the English examples it rains\" and it was known by everyone (that) he had travelled the world\".\nOrdering of possessive pronouns.\nThe ordering of possessive pronouns is somewhat freer than in Swedish or Danish. When there is no adjective, the most common word order is the one used in the examples in the table above, where the possessive comes after the noun, while the noun is in its definite form; ('my book'). If one wishes to emphasize the owner of the noun, the possessive pronoun will usually be placed first. In Bokm\u00e5l, however, due to its Danish origins, one could choose to always write the possessive first: ('my car'), but this may sound very formal. Some dialects that have been very influenced by Danish also do this; some speakers in B\u00e6rum and the west of Oslo may always use this word order. When there is an adjective describing the noun, the possessive pronoun will always come first: ('my own car').\nDeterminers.\nThe closed class of Norwegian determiners are declined in gender and number in agreement with their argument. Not all determiners are inflected.\nParticle classes.\nNorwegian has five closed classes without inflection, i.e. lexical categories with grammatical function and a finite number of members that may not be distinguished by morphological criteria. These are interjections, conjunctions, subjunctions, prepositions, and adverbs. The inclusion of adverbs here requires that traditional adverbs that are inflected in comparison be classified as adjectives, as is sometimes done.\nAdverbs.\nAdverbs can be formed from adjectives in Norwegian. English usually creates adverbs from adjectives by the suffix \"-ly\", like the adverb \"beautifully\" from the adjective \"beautiful.\" By comparison, Scandinavian languages usually form adverbs from adjectives by the grammatical neuter singular form of the adjective. This is in general true for both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\nExample (Bokm\u00e5l):\nIn the third sentence, is an adverb. In the first and second sentence and are adjectives and must agree in grammatical gender with the noun.\nAnother example is the adjective ('beautiful') which exists in both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l and has the neuter singular form .\nExample (Nynorsk):\nCompound words.\nIn Norwegian compound words, the head, i.e. the part determining the compound's class, is the last part. If the compound word is constructed from many different nouns, the last noun in the compound noun will determine the gender of the compound noun. Only the first part has primary stress. For instance, the compound ('think tank') has primary stress on the first syllable and is a masculine noun since the noun is masculine.\nCompound words are written together in Norwegian, which can cause words to become very long, for example ('maximum likelihood estimator') and ('human rights organizations'). Other examples are the title ('Chief Justice of the Supreme Court', originally a combination of \"supreme court\" and the actual title, \"justiciar\") and the translation for \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\nIf they are not written together, each part is naturally read with primary stress, and the meaning of the compound is lost. Examples of this in English are the difference between a green house and a greenhouse or a black board and a blackboard.\nThis is sometimes forgotten, occasionally with humorous results. Instead of writing, for example, \"\" ('lamb chops'), people make the mistake of writing ('lame', or 'paralyzed', 'chops'). The original message can even be reversed, as when (lit. 'smoke-free', meaning no smoking) becomes ('smoke freely').\nOther examples include:\nThese misunderstandings occur because most nouns can be interpreted as verbs or other types of words.\nSimilar misunderstandings can be achieved in English too. The following are examples of phrases that both in Norwegian and English mean one thing as a compound word, and something different when regarded as separate words:\nSyntax.\nWord order.\nNorwegian syntax is predominantly SVO. The subject occupies the sentence-initial position, followed by the verb and then the object. Like many other Germanic languages, it follows the V2 rule, which means that the finite verb is invariably the second element in a sentence. For example:\n\u2022 ('I eat fish \"today\"')\n\u2022 ('I want to drink coffee \"today\"')\nExceptions to the rule are embedded clauses and question phrases.\nNegation.\nNegation in Norwegian is expressed by the word , which literally means 'not' and is placed after the finite verb. Exceptions are embedded clauses.\n\u2022 ('The dog did not return with the ball.')\n\u2022 ('It was the dog that did not return.')\nContractions with the negation, as is accepted in for example English (\"cannot\", \"hadn't\", \"didn't\") are limited to dialects and colloquial speech. In this case contractions apply to the negation and the verb. Otherwise is applied in similar ways as the English \"not\" and general negation.\nAdverbs.\nAdverbs follow the verb they modify. Depending on the type of adverb, the order in which they appear in the phrase is pre-determined. Manner adverbs for example, precede temporal adverbs. Switching the order of these adverbs would not render the phrase ungrammatical, but would make it sound awkward. Compare this to the English phrase \"John probably already ate dinner.\" Switching the adverbs' position (\"already\" and \"probably\") to \"John already probably ate dinner\" is not incorrect, but sounds unnatural. For more information, see Cartographic syntax.\n\u2022 ('She sang touchingly beautiful.')\n\u2022 ('She sang unbelievably loud.')\nThe adverb may precede the verb when the focus of the sentence is shifted. If special attention should be directed on the temporal aspect of the sentence, the adverb can be fronted. Since the V2 rule requires the finite verb to syntactically occupy the second position in the clause, the verb consequently also moves in front of the subject.\n\u2022 (Today\", I want\"' to drink coffee')\n\u2022 (Today\", I eat fish')\nOnly one adverb may precede the verb, unless it belongs to a bigger constituent, in which case it does not modify the main verb in the phrase, but is part of the constituent.\n\u2022 ('She ate the soup quickly yesterday.')\n\u2022 ('Yesterday she ate the soup quickly.')\nAdjectives.\nAttributive adjectives always precede the noun that they modify.\n\u2022 ('The three big fat heavy red books stood on the shelf.')\n\u2022 ('The other fortunately long thin key fit'.)"}

{"id": "21708", "revid": "1104511830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21708", "title": "Nonstandard analysis", "text": "The history of calculus is fraught with philosophical debates about the meaning and logical validity of fluxions or infinitesimal numbers. The standard way to resolve these debates is to define the operations of calculus using epsilon\u2013delta procedures rather than infinitesimals. Nonstandard analysis instead reformulates the calculus using a logically rigorous notion of infinitesimal numbers.\nNonstandard analysis originated in the early 1960s by the mathematician Abraham Robinson. He wrote:\n... the idea of infinitely small or \"infinitesimal\" quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition. At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus. As for the objection ... that the distance between two distinct real numbers cannot be infinitely small, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz argued that the theory of infinitesimals implies the introduction of ideal numbers which might be infinitely small or infinitely large compared with the real numbers but which were \"to possess the same properties as the latter.\"\nRobinson argued that this law of continuity of Leibniz's is a precursor of the transfer principle. Robinson continued:\nHowever, neither he nor his disciples and successors were able to give a rational development leading up to a system of this sort. As a result, the theory of infinitesimals gradually fell into disrepute and was replaced eventually by the classical theory of limits.\nRobinson continues:\n... Leibniz's ideas can be fully vindicated and ... they lead to a novel and fruitful approach to classical Analysis and to many other branches of mathematics. The key to our method is provided by the detailed analysis of the relation between mathematical languages and mathematical structures which lies at the bottom of contemporary model theory.\nIn 1973, intuitionist Arend Heyting praised nonstandard analysis as \"a standard model of important mathematical research\".\nIntroduction.\nA non-zero element of an ordered field formula_1 is infinitesimal if and only if its absolute value is smaller than any element of formula_1 of the form formula_3, for formula_4 a standard natural number. Ordered fields that have infinitesimal elements are also called non-Archimedean. More generally, nonstandard analysis is any form of mathematics that relies on nonstandard models and the transfer principle. A field that satisfies the transfer principle for real numbers is called a real closed field, and nonstandard real analysis uses these fields as \"nonstandard models\" of the real numbers.\nRobinson's original approach was based on these nonstandard models of the field of real numbers. His classic foundational book on the subject \"Nonstandard Analysis\" was published in 1966 and is still in print. On page 88, Robinson writes:\nThe existence of nonstandard models of arithmetic was discovered by Thoralf Skolem (1934). Skolem's method foreshadows the ultrapower construction [...]\nSeveral technical issues must be addressed to develop a calculus of infinitesimals. For example, it is not enough to construct an ordered field with infinitesimals. See the article on hyperreal numbers for a discussion of some of the relevant ideas.\nBasic definitions.\nIn this section we outline one of the simplest approaches to defining a hyperreal field formula_5. Let formula_6 be the field of real numbers, and let formula_7 be the semiring of natural numbers. Denote by formula_8 the set of sequences of real numbers. A field formula_5 is defined as a suitable quotient of formula_10, as follows. Take a nonprincipal ultrafilter formula_11. In particular, formula_12 contains the Fr\u00e9chet filter. Consider a pair of sequences\nWe say that formula_14 and formula_15 are equivalent if they coincide on a set of indices that is a member of the ultrafilter, or in formulas:\nThe quotient of formula_10 by the resulting equivalence relation is a hyperreal field formula_5, a situation summarized by the formula formula_19.\nMotivation.\nThere are at least three reasons to consider nonstandard analysis: historical, pedagogical, and technical.\nHistorical.\nMuch of the earliest development of the infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz was formulated using expressions such as \"infinitesimal number\" and \"vanishing quantity\". As noted in the article on hyperreal numbers, these formulations were widely criticized by George Berkeley and others. The challenge of developing a consistent and satisfactory theory of analysis using infinitesimals was first met by Abraham Robinson.\nIn 1958 Curt Schmieden and Detlef Laugwitz published an article \"Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung\" (\"An Extension of Infinitesimal Calculus\") which proposed a construction of a ring containing infinitesimals. The ring was constructed from sequences of real numbers. Two sequences were considered equivalent if they differed only in a finite number of elements. Arithmetic operations were defined elementwise. However, the ring constructed in this way contains zero divisors and thus cannot be a field.\nPedagogical.\nH. Jerome Keisler, David Tall, and other educators maintain that the use of infinitesimals is more intuitive and more easily grasped by students than the \"epsilon\u2013delta\" approach to analytic concepts. This approach can sometimes provide easier proofs of results than the corresponding epsilon\u2013delta formulation of the proof. Much of the simplification comes from applying very easy rules of nonstandard arithmetic, as follows:\ntogether with the transfer principle mentioned below.\nAnother pedagogical application of nonstandard analysis is Edward Nelson's treatment of the theory of stochastic processes.\nTechnical.\nSome recent work has been done in analysis using concepts from nonstandard analysis, particularly in investigating limiting processes of statistics and mathematical physics. Sergio Albeverio et al. discuss some of these applications.\nApproaches to nonstandard analysis.\nThere are two main different approaches to nonstandard analysis: the semantic or model-theoretic approach and the syntactic approach. Both of these approaches apply to other areas of mathematics beyond analysis, including number theory, algebra and topology.\nRobinson's original formulation of nonstandard analysis falls into the category of the \"semantic approach\". As developed by him in his papers, it is based on studying models (in particular saturated models) of a theory. Since Robinson's work first appeared, a simpler semantic approach (due to Elias Zakon) has been developed using purely set-theoretic objects called superstructures. In this approach \"a model of a theory\" is replaced by an object called a \"superstructure\" over a set . Starting from a superstructure one constructs another object using the ultrapower construction together with a mapping that satisfies the transfer principle. The map * relates formal properties of and . Moreover, it is possible to consider a simpler form of saturation called countable saturation. This simplified approach is also more suitable for use by mathematicians who are not specialists in model theory or logic.\nThe \"syntactic approach\" requires much less logic and model theory to understand and use. This approach was developed in the mid-1970s by the mathematician Edward Nelson. Nelson introduced an entirely axiomatic formulation of nonstandard analysis that he called internal set theory (IST). IST is an extension of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZF) in that alongside the basic binary membership relation \u2208, it introduces a new unary predicate \"standard\", which can be applied to elements of the mathematical universe together with some axioms for reasoning with this new predicate.\nSyntactic nonstandard analysis requires a great deal of care in applying the principle of set formation (formally known as the axiom of comprehension), which mathematicians usually take for granted. As Nelson points out, a fallacy in reasoning in IST is that of \"illegal set formation\". For instance, there is no set in IST whose elements are precisely the standard integers (here \"standard\" is understood in the sense of the new predicate). To avoid illegal set formation, one must only use predicates of ZFC to define subsets.\nAnother example of the syntactic approach is the Alternative Set Theory introduced by Petr Vop\u011bnka, trying to find set-theory axioms more compatible with the nonstandard analysis than the axioms of ZF.\nRobinson's book.\nAbraham Robinson's book \"Nonstandard analysis\" was published in 1966. Some of the topics developed in the book were already present in his 1961 article by the same title (Robinson 1961). In addition to containing the first full treatment of nonstandard analysis, the book contains a detailed historical section where Robinson challenges some of the received opinions on the history of mathematics based on the pre\u2013nonstandard analysis perception of infinitesimals as inconsistent entities. Thus, Robinson challenges the idea that Augustin-Louis Cauchy's \"sum theorem\" in Cours d'Analyse concerning the convergence of a series of continuous functions was incorrect, and proposes an infinitesimal-based interpretation of its hypothesis that results in a correct theorem.\nInvariant subspace problem.\nAbraham Robinson and Allen Bernstein used nonstandard analysis to prove that every polynomially compact linear operator on a Hilbert space has an invariant subspace.\nGiven an operator on Hilbert space , consider the orbit of a point in under the iterates of . Applying Gram\u2013Schmidt one obtains an orthonormal basis for . Let be the corresponding nested sequence of \"coordinate\" subspaces of . The matrix expressing with respect to is almost upper triangular, in the sense that the coefficients are the only nonzero sub-diagonal coefficients. Bernstein and Robinson show that if is polynomially compact, then there is a hyperfinite index such that the matrix coefficient is infinitesimal. Next, consider the subspace of . If in has finite norm, then is infinitely close to .\nNow let be the operator formula_20 acting on , where is the orthogonal projection to . Denote by the polynomial such that is compact. The subspace is internal of hyperfinite dimension. By transferring upper triangularisation of operators of finite-dimensional complex vector space, there is an internal orthonormal Hilbert space basis for where runs from to , such that each of the corresponding -dimensional subspaces is -invariant. Denote by the projection to the subspace . For a nonzero vector of finite norm in , one can assume that is nonzero, or to fix ideas. Since is a compact operator, is infinitely close to and therefore one has also . Now let be the greatest index such that formula_21. Then the space of all standard elements infinitely close to is the desired invariant subspace.\nUpon reading a preprint of the Bernstein and Robinson paper, Paul Halmos reinterpreted their proof using standard techniques. Both papers appeared back-to-back in the same issue of the \"Pacific Journal of Mathematics\". Some of the ideas used in Halmos' proof reappeared many years later in Halmos' own work on quasi-triangular operators.\nOther applications.\nOther results were received along the line of reinterpreting or reproving previously known results. Of particular interest is Teturo Kamae's proof of the individual ergodic theorem or L. van den Dries and Alex Wilkie's treatment of Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth. Nonstandard analysis was used by Larry Manevitz and Shmuel Weinberger to prove a result in algebraic topology.\nThe real contributions of nonstandard analysis lie however in the concepts and theorems that utilize the new extended language of nonstandard set theory. Among the list of new applications in mathematics there are new approaches to probability,\nhydrodynamics, measure theory, nonsmooth and harmonic analysis, etc.\nThere are also applications of nonstandard analysis to the theory of stochastic processes, particularly constructions of Brownian motion as random walks. Albeverio et al. have an excellent introduction to this area of research.\nApplications to calculus.\nAs an application to mathematical education, H. Jerome Keisler wrote \"\". Covering nonstandard calculus, it develops differential and integral calculus using the hyperreal numbers, which include infinitesimal elements. These applications of nonstandard analysis depend on the existence of the \"standard part\" of a finite hyperreal . The standard part of , denoted , is a standard real number infinitely close to . One of the visualization devices Keisler uses is that of an imaginary infinite-magnification microscope to distinguish points infinitely close together. Keisler's book is now out of print, but is freely available from his website; see references below.\nCritique.\nDespite the elegance and appeal of some aspects of nonstandard analysis, criticisms have been voiced, as well, such as those by Errett Bishop, Alain Connes, and Paul Halmos, as documented at criticism of nonstandard analysis.\nLogical framework.\nGiven any set , the \"superstructure\" over a set is the set defined by the conditions\nThus the superstructure over is obtained by starting from and iterating the operation of adjoining the power set of and taking the union of the resulting sequence. The superstructure over the real numbers includes a wealth of mathematical structures: For instance, it contains isomorphic copies of all separable metric spaces and metrizable topological vector spaces. Virtually all of mathematics that interests an analyst goes on within .\nThe working view of nonstandard analysis is a set and a mapping that satisfies some additional properties. To formulate these principles we first state some definitions.\nA formula has \"bounded quantification\" if and only if the only quantifiers that occur in the formula have range restricted over sets, that is are all of the form:\nFor example, the formula\nhas bounded quantification, the universally quantified variable ranges over , the existentially quantified variable ranges over the powerset of . On the other hand,\ndoes not have bounded quantification because the quantification of \"y\" is unrestricted.\nInternal sets.\nA set \"x\" is \"internal\" if and only if \"x\" is an element of *\"A\" for some element \"A\" of . *\"A\" itself is internal if \"A\" belongs to .\nWe now formulate the basic logical framework of nonstandard analysis:\nOne can show using ultraproducts that such a map * exists. Elements of are called \"standard\". Elements of are called hyperreal numbers.\nFirst consequences.\nThe symbol denotes the nonstandard natural numbers. By the extension principle, this is a superset of . The set is nonempty. To see this, apply countable saturation to the sequence of internal sets\nThe sequence has a nonempty intersection, proving the result.\nWe begin with some definitions: Hyperreals \"r\", \"s\" are \"infinitely close\" if and only if\nA hyperreal is \"infinitesimal\" if and only if it is infinitely close to 0. For example, if is a hyperinteger, i.e. an element of , then is an infinitesimal. A hyperreal is \"limited\" (or \"finite\") if and only if its absolute value is dominated by (less than) a standard integer. The limited hyperreals form a subring of containing the reals. In this ring, the infinitesimal hyperreals are an ideal.\nThe set of limited hyperreals or the set of infinitesimal hyperreals are \"external\" subsets of ; what this means in practice is that bounded quantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over these sets.\nExample: The plane with and ranging over is internal, and is a model of plane Euclidean geometry. The plane with and restricted to limited values (analogous to the Dehn plane) is external, and in this limited plane the parallel postulate is violated. For example, any line passing through the point on the -axis and having infinitesimal slope is parallel to the -axis.\nTheorem. For any limited hyperreal there is a unique standard real denoted infinitely close to .

While it identifies itself as promoting a form of Islam, its beliefs differ considerably from mainstream Islamic traditions. Scholars of religion characterize it as a new religious movement. It operates as a centralized and hierarchical organization.\nThe Nation teaches that there has been a succession of mortal gods, each a black man named Allah, of whom Fard Muhammad is the most recent. It claims that the first Allah created the earliest humans, the Arabic-speaking, dark-skinned Tribe of Shabazz, whose members possessed inner divinity and from whom all people of color are descended. It maintains that a scientist named Yakub then created the white race. The whites lacked inner divinity, and were intrinsically violent; they overthrew the Tribe of Shabazz and achieved global dominance. Setting itself against the white-dominated society of the United States, the NOI campaigns for the creation of an independent African American nation-state, and calls for African Americans to be economically self-sufficient and separatist. A millenarian tradition, it maintains that Fard Muhammad will soon return aboard a spaceship, the \"Mother Plane\" or \"Mother Ship,\" to wipe out the white race and establish a utopia. Members worship in buildings called mosques or temples. Practitioners are expected to live disciplined lives, adhering to strict dress codes, specific dietary requirements, and patriarchal gender roles.\nWallace Fard Muhammad established the Nation of Islam in Detroit. He drew on various sources, including Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science Temple of America, black nationalist trends like Garveyism, and black-oriented forms of Freemasonry. After Fard Muhammad disappeared in 1934, the leadership of the NOI was assumed by Elijah Muhammad. He expanded the NOI's teachings and declared Fard Muhammad to be the latest Allah. Attracting growing attention in the late 1950s and 1960s, the NOI's influence expanded through high-profile members such as the black nationalist activist Malcolm X and the boxer Muhammad Ali. Deeming it a threat to domestic security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation worked to undermine the group. Following Elijah Muhammad's death in 1975, his son Warith Deen Mohammed took over the organization, moving it towards Sunni Islam and renaming it the World Community of Islam in the West. Members seeking to retain Elijah Muhammad's teachings re-established the Nation of Islam under Louis Farrakhan's leadership in 1977. Farrakhan has continued to develop the NOI's beliefs, for instance by drawing connections with Dianetics, and expanding its economic and agricultural operations.\nBased in the United States, the Nation of Islam has also established a presence abroad, with membership open only to people of color. In 2007, it was estimated to have 50,000 members. The Nation has proven to be particularly successful at converting prisoners. The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have accused it of being a black supremacist hate group that promotes racial prejudice towards white people, anti-semitism, and anti-LGBT rhetoric. Muslim critics accuse it of promoting teachings that are not authentically Islamic.\nDefinition.\nThe Nation of Islam is a new religious movement, an \"ethno-religious movement\", and a social movement. Scholars of religion have also classified it as resembling UFO religions, with UFOs featuring in its ideas about the forthcoming end of the world. Although employing the same name, the Nation of Islam has represented two distinct organizations: the first was established by Wallace Fard Muhammad in the 1930s and lasted until 1975, and the second then created by Louis Farrakhan in the late 1970s.\nThe Nation draws heavily on both Christianity and Islam, although it interprets the Bible and Quran differently from Christians or mainstream Muslims. A black nationalist religion and an African American religion, it seeks to reclaim what it regards as the historic Islamic identity of African Americans. Its members have been called \"Black Muslims,\" and its second leader, Elijah Muhammad, stated that \"Islam is the natural religion of the Black Nation.\" Islamic elements in its practices include the use of the Arabic language, prayers five times a day, and the adoption of a flag based on that of Islamic-majority Turkey. A Muslim identity appealed to the NOI as it offered an alternative to mainstream, Christian-dominated American culture. The Nation denigrates Christianity, regarding it as a tool of white supremacy, and claims that it lacks the rational and scientific basis of its own teachings.\nThe religion promoted by the Nation has been described as \"Fardian Islam,\" \"nontraditional Islam,\" and \"quasi-Islamic\". The Nation sees itself as part of the Islamic world, although it has little in common with mainstream forms of Islam. Herbert Berg commented that it had only a \"superficial relationship to other Islams\" such as the Sunni, Shi'ite and Sufi traditions, while Jason Eric Fishman and Ana Bel\u00e9n Soage observed that although the Nation uses many standard Islamic terms, it gives them \"profoundly different meanings\" to those understood by most Muslims. The Nation's views differ from the Five Pillars, which are typically seen as central to Islamic belief and practice; its claims that Allah (God) takes anthropomorphic form and that there is no afterlife differ fundamentally from standard Islam. Unlike most forms of Islam, the NOI does not teach that the 6th/7th century Arabian religious leader Muhammad was the final nor the most important messenger of God, instead treating its first two leaders, Fard Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad, as being more important.\nFrom mainstream Islamic perspectives, its teachings are heretical, with its theology being \"shirk\" (blasphemy). Mainstream Muslims view it as \"a religious movement which has selectively adopted some Islamic beliefs and concepts,\" but which is not \"truly Islamic.\"\nThe Nation is a highly centralized, hierarchical movement, and has been described as authoritarian. Unlike practitioners of Rastafari, a contemporary of the NOI which shares many of its key concerns, members of the Nation do not exhibit considerable variation in their approach to the religion, displaying a high degree of uniformity and conformity among followers. However, there is no specific holy text produced by the NOI, and its teachings have not remained static, but have changed throughout its history. Over the course of its history it has for instance adopted additional elements from mainstream Islam, and Farrakhan's second Nation also bears some distinct differences from its predecessor.\nBeliefs.\nTheology.\nThe sociologist of religion David V. Barrett noted that the Nation's theology is \"very distinct\" and \"extremely detailed.\" The Nation provides conflicting statements about its theology; although it professes commitment to the monotheistic idea of a single God, its discourse refers to multiple gods, meaning that it can be interpreted as polytheistic. These gods are described as being anthropomorphic, taking human form.\nThe NOI teaches that history can be divided into distinct cycles, each ruled by a new god who takes over from his predecessor. The Nation teaches that none of these gods are immortal, but all die, at which a new god will take their place. A central tenet of its theology is the portrayal of Allah as a black man, and Nation members believe that this was the form that the first god consciously took. Each god has different abilities and degrees of power. The Nation regards its founder, Fard Muhammad, as the latest of these gods, or \"God in person\". They believe that he is the first god to have the same powers as the inaugural god, namely the ability to return the universe to its primordial darkness and then recreate it, for he has developed the divine capacity innate to black people to the maximum degree. It teaches that although this founder disappeared in 1934, he had secretly moved to Mecca and would live for another 409 years. For the Nation, he takes on the traditional roles of God, the Mahdi, and the Messiah.\nThe Nation promotes the idea that \"God is man and man is God, that God has a presence inside human individuals.\" It teaches that the black race, in its natural state, is divine; collectively, the black race is God, or a \"nation of Gods\". Elijah Muhammad said that \"all Muslims are Allahs.\" According to its teachings, \"knowledge of self\" is key for black people to realize their inner divinity. The NOI thus teaches that by following its teachings, one can recognize one's inner Godliness.\nFishman and Soage highlighted that the Nation's \"core theological principles are completely divorced from the traditional Islamic faith.\" The Nation's theology differs from the mainstream Islamic belief in a fundamental ontological divide between humanity and God; in mainstream Islam, Allah is always portrayed as eternal and non-anthropomorphic, which is at odds with the theology of the NOI. Also conflicting with mainstream Islam is the NOI's claim that there is no afterlife; Elijah Muhammad wrote that \"when you are dead, you are DEAD.\" He taught that there is no spiritual realm, with the material universe being all that exists, although he also stated that humans could develop parapsychological powers and that he personally had telepathic abilities.\nCosmogony and the Tribe of Shabazz.\nThe Nation teaches that in the beginning there was nothing but darkness. Then, 76 trillion years ago, the first god willed himself into being, taking 6 million years to form into his desired appearance; that of a black man. In this account, this god chose his skin color in reference to the blackness from which he had emerged. According to the Nation, the first god then created the Sun and the planets. As his helpers, he created more black men and took his place on a council of 24 imams; 12 greater and 12 lesser. Each of these imams takes a turn being god for one cycle each. 15,000 years ago, these ancient scientists\u2014who had knowledge of the future\u2014wrote their knowledge down in a text, the Mother Book. Parts of this, the NOI claims, have been given to humanity as the Torah, Gospels, and Quran.\nThe Nation holds that the moon was created when one of the scientists tried to destroy the Earth with explosives, resulting in a chunk of the Earth's mass being forced into orbit. The Nation also alleges that Asia and Africa were once a single continent.\nIn endorsing a form of creationism, the Nation rejects evolution and believes that the existence of dinosaurs is a hoax perpetrated by members of the white race.\nThe NOI promotes numerology, the belief that numbers possess hidden meanings; it believes that the number 19 is key to decoding scriptures such as the Quran, and takes the view that it is meaningful that the names of both Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan have 14 letters in them.\nThe Nation teaches that the first humans were the \"Original\" or \"Asiatic\" race, whom it describes as members of the Tribe of Shabazz. It claims that this Tribe inhabited Egypt's Nile Valley as well as the area around Mecca in the Arabian peninsula; Elijah Muhammad claimed that Mecca was the Tribe's original home and \"the ONLY HOLY SPOT on our planet\". He claimed that the Tribe were Muslim and that their language was Arabic. In the Nation's discourse, these early humans are labelled \"black\", described as having dark skin as well as smooth, straight hair, closely resembling dark-complexioned Arabians or South Asians rather than Sub-Saharan Africans. Elijah Muhammad claimed that some of this Original Race were later given Afro-textured hair to assist their lives in the \"jungles of East Asia\", by which he meant Africa.\nThe NOI's conception of race differs from that of most Americans. For the Nation, everyone not of West European genetic origin is a descendant of the Original Asiatic Race. In the group's discourse, \"black\" does not simply mean those of Sub-Saharan African genetic descent, but all people of color, including Asians, North Africans, and Native Americans; only light-skinned people of West European descent are excluded. Elijah Muhammad for instance referred to \"black, brown, yellow [and] red\" people as collectively constituting \"black mankind\", which he then juxtaposed against the \"white race\". He considered some East Europeans, such as Albanians, to be descendants of the Original Asiatic Race. The Nation teaches that all descendants of the Original Race were Muslims by their intrinsic nature, but that many created heretical deviations such as Hinduism; some of those who broke Islamic rules were exiled from Asia-Africa to North America, where they became the continent's native population.\nThe myth of Yakub and the white race.\nThe NOI promotes a story called the myth of Yakub, which received its fullest exposition in Elijah Muhammad's 1965 book \"Message to the Blackman\". Yakub is presented as a black scientist who was a child prodigy; by the age of 18 he had learned everything that Mecca's universities had to teach him. He attracted a following but caused trouble, leading the Meccan authorities to exile him and his 6000 followers to Pelan, the Mediterranean island of Patmos.\nThere, the NOI claims, Yakub engaged in a selective breeding program to create the white race. This entailed breeding new children, with those who were too dark being killed at birth and their bodies being fed to wild animals or incinerated. Over two centuries, Yakub's experiments created a group of blonde, light-skinned people, the white race. The myth of Yakub presents the white race as being degenerate, sub-human, and bereft of divinity. Because of this, the NOI teaches that white people are intrinsically prone to lying, violence, and brutality. Elijah Muhammad repeatedly referred to the white man as the devil. Its ideas regarding white people have been labelled both racist and racialist.\nAccording to the Nation's teachings, Yakub's newly created white race sowed discord among the black race, and thus were exiled to live in the caves of Europe. In this narrative, it was in Europe that the white race engaged in bestiality and degenerated, resulting in the emergence of apes and monkeys. Aware of their role in the future, Allah sent Moses to teach the white race to cook and wear clothes. According to the Nation, Jesus of Nazareth was also sent to try and civilise the white race; Farrakhan's NOI has taught that Jesus was not the Messiah, as Christians believe, but that he instead pointed to the later coming of the true messiah, Elijah Muhammad. They reject the Christian belief that Jesus was God, that he was the product of a virgin birth, or that he was crucified and resurrected.\nIn the Nation's teachings, Allah permitted the white race to rule the Earth for 6000 years, a period that is almost at an end. The NOI teaches that the white race spread out from Europe and began to dominate the world. It conquered and enslaved the Tribe of Shabazz, shipping many of them to the Americas as part of the Atlantic slave trade. It claims that most of these enslaved blacks forgot their true names, their Arabic language, and their Muslim identity, instead embracing Christianity, the religion of the white oppressor. In this enslaved state, the black people lost their morality, engaging in sinful behaviour such as fornication and drinking alcohol. The Nation teaches that Allah allowed all this to happen so that the black race would realise humanity's inner potential for evil and discover how to defeat it, thus enabling them to realize their divine capacity and become Gods.\nThe subjugation of African Americans is thus seen as part of an ancient white conspiracy. According to the NOI, most whites are unaware of their true origins, but that senior Freemasons have this knowledge. It interprets opposition to the Nation from the U.S. government and white society as evidence of this. The United States is equated with the city of Babylon as presented in the Bible. According to the Nation, 1914 marked the end of the 6000 years of white rule.\nThe Nation interprets many of the problems facing the African American community in this light, for instance, Farrakhan has claimed that the white establishment has encouraged a black gang culture to provide an excuse for the police killing of black youths, and that they are also responsible for flooding black-majority urban areas with drugs. Both Farrakhan and senior NOI spokesperson Abdul Alim Muhammad have claimed that the white establishment created the AIDS virus to exterminate black people. The Nation is openly critical of U.S. aggression towards countries with non-white majorities, especially when those countries also have Muslim majorities. In keeping with its anti-Western ethos, it has also adopted a consistently anti-Israel position, being both anti-Zionist and anti-imperialist.\nChristianity is seen as \"white man's religion.\" It is regarded as having perpetuated white domination and furthered the oppression of the African diaspora in the Americas; it is also associated with slavery and colonialism in the Nation of Islam's discourse. The religion is treated with suspicion out of the belief that the oppressed (African Americans) and the oppressors (European Americans) cannot share the same God.\nDuring the time when Malcolm X was a member and leader of the Nation of Islam, he preached that black people were genetically superior to white people but were dominated by a system of white supremacy: \nEschatology and the Mother Plane.\nThe NOI is millenarian, believing that humanity is living in end times. It propounds a distinct eschatology drawing on the Book of Revelation. Central to its view of the apocalypse is a large spaceship, known as the Wheel, the Mother Plane, or the Mother Ship. Members usually refer to it with female pronouns. Elijah Muhammad described this as \"a small human planet,\" claiming that it is half a mile by half a mile in diameter. The Nation teaches that this vessel is the Merkabah that appears in the Book of Ezekiel (1: 4\u201328). It teaches that Allah and many of his scientists live in a magnificent city on the Mother Plane, from which they monitor humanity; Farrakhan has claimed that Elijah Muhammad never died but is resident aboard this ship. The Nation teaches that there are also smaller vessels, \"baby planes,\" docked inside the Mother Ship and that these travel to visit Earth.\nThe Nation teaches that a period of deteriorating inter-racial tensions will culminate in the apocalypse. NOI members have repeatedly claimed that this apocalypse is imminent; Farrakhan for instance predicted that the Gulf War of 1990 would spark it, while Tynetta Muhammad predicted it would occur in 2001. According to Nation teaching, the Mother Plane will appear above the Earth and transport the righteous to live upon it. It will then use the baby planes to place bombs beneath the Earth's surface, which will explode and wipe out the old, white-dominated order. The Earth's atmosphere will then burn for 390 years and spend another 610 cooling down.\nOnce the Earth has returned to a habitable state, Allah will return the righteous to live there, in a new black paradise. In his book \"The Supreme Wisdom\", Elijah Muhammad claimed that after the apocalypse, \"Peace, joy and happiness will have no end.\" Those living in this perfect society will eat the finest food and wear clothes of silk interwoven with gold. The NOI has taught that the white ruling elite are aware of this forthcoming apocalypse and that the U.S. exploration of space and the Strategic Defense Initiative are futile attempts to protect themselves against the Mother Plane.\nBlack nationalism and separatism.\nIdeologically, the NOI is black nationalist, and has sometimes been perceived as a Black Power political organization. Scholar of religion Mattias Gardell commented that the idea of black unity is \"at the very core of the NOI ideology.\" It seeks to empower black people by giving them a positive self-identity, purging ideas of white superiority, and black inferiority, from its followers. In the Nation's view, black liberation requires a religious dimension.\nIt regards African Americans, or black people more broadly, as the Chosen People, espousing a cosmology in which the black race is superior and the white race inferior.\nThe Nation is black separatist, rejecting the integration of the black and white races. It called for the creation of a separate and sovereign African American nation-state in the southern part of what is currently the United States, portraying this as compensation for the unpaid labor of their enslaved ancestors. Farrakhan has also suggested that the countries of Africa should set aside land on that continent for the African diaspora, characterising this as a reparation for the complicity of West African states in the Atlantic slave trade.\nIt cites the formation of Israel as a state for the Jewish people in 1948 as a precedent for the establishment of such a state. Gardell suggested that any such black state formed under the Nation's leadership would be theocratic, authoritarian, and totalitarian. In his view, the Nation's political stance incorporated elements associated with both the right and left, and in doing so was similar to the stance of the far-right Third Position.\nThe Nation's racial separatism was at odds with the mainstream civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The Nation was critical of African American activists who promoted racial integration, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, regarding them as \"Uncle Tom Negroes.\" In contrast to King's calls for non-violent protest against segregation and racial violence, the Nation maintained it was a moral obligation for African Americans to defend their community from attack. As a NOI spokesman, Malcolm X claimed that while they would not instigate violence, the Nation would use it to defend themselves.\nUnlike the Garveyites and Rastafari who strongly emphasise links between the African diaspora and Africa itself, Elijah Muhammad and the NOI have instead focused their attention on the African diaspora in the Americas, rejecting a specifically Pan-African ideology. Elijah Muhammad stated that \"where as the Black man in Africa is our brother, our central responsibility is with the Black man here in the wilderness of North America.\" Rather than treating Africa as a homeland, the Nation's origin myths present Mecca in Saudi Arabia as the original home of African Americans; Africa itself was often portrayed in Nation writings as the least desirable of the Original Asiatic lands.\nGender and sexuality issues.\nThe NOI's teachings on gender issues are conservative and patriarchal, promoting strict gender roles for men and women. Emphasis is placed on the family unit; the Nation maintains that the security of the black family unit is ensured when its members adhere to their gendered duties and responsibilities.\nSeeking to restore black manhood, the Nation expresses great concern regarding the emasculation of black men, attributing this attitude to the failure of black men to prevent the sexual assault of black women by white men over the centuries. It expects men to be providers for their family. Women are expected to act as caretakers of the household and the children, and are cautioned from forming friendships with men. Outsiders often perceive the Nation's women as being victims of male oppression and control.\nThe group's leadership is overwhelmingly male, although several women rose to senior positions during the 1990s; in 1998 the Nation appointed its first woman minister, Ava Muhammad, as head of Mosque Number 15 in Georgia. In various cases, Nation women still play an active role in their communities, sometimes challenging established gender norms in the organization.\nThe NOI strictly enforces heterosexual monogamy among its members and encourages sexual abstinence prior to marriage. Members seeking to court another are expected to inform the captain of their local FOI or MGT about their intentions.\nMen found to have beaten their wives are temporarily suspended from Nation membership. Divorce is frowned upon, but not forbidden. Children are expected to study hard, avoid street culture, and respect their elders. Farrakhan was initially highly critical of rap music because he argued it promoted sexual promiscuity.\nAlthough Nation members are allowed to marry non-members, the group stipulates that they should only marry other black people, claiming that sex with white women emasculates black men. Birth control methods are criticised as an attempt by the white establishment to lower the black birthrate, although Farrakhan stated support for abortion in cases of rape or incest or where the woman's life is endangered by the pregnancy.\nSame-sex relationships are condemned as immoral; Farrakhan for instance banned gay men from his Million Man March, bringing accusations of homophobia against him and the Nation.\nPractices.\nServices, prayer, and celebration.\nDuring the 1960s, the NOI's places of worship were called both temples and mosques. As well as serving a religious function, these can also be used as a community center, bank, school, and child-care facility.\nThose attending meetings will sometimes be searched by members of the Fruit of Islam (FOI) or the Muslim Girl's Training group, who look both for weapons and for objects like cosmetics and cigarettes which are disapproved of. After this, the attendees are seen to their seats, usually rows of benches. The sexes are segregated during worship, women on the right and men on the left. The tone of Nation services is sombre and quiet. Services typically begin with the statement \"As-salamu alaykum\" (peace be upon you), with the congregation responding \"Wa 'alaikum As-salam\" (and also upon you). Meetings at the mosque are both opened and closed with prayers, and the Nation's \"national anthem\" may be played. A lecture will be provided by one of the ministers. The minister may read out verses selected from either the Bible or Qur'an.\nIn the late 1950s, Elijah Muhammad published a prayer manual outlining how his followers should pray five times a day; this involved an ablution beforehand. He stipulated that these prayers should be in English, although commented that in future he would explain how to do so in Arabic. In later articles, he explained that his followers should face towards Mecca as they pray, symbolising their journey toward the restoration of black greatness.\nThe most important date in the Nation's year is February 26, Saviours' Day, which is believed to be the birthday of Fard Muhammad. This is the date on which the organization holds its annual national convention. Under Farrakhan, the Nation has also held a second Saviour's Day each year, on October 7, to mark the birth of Elijah Muhammad.\nMembers are encouraged to make the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca; Elijah Muhammad himself did so three times.\nLifestyle.\nThe Nation requests that new members change any names inherited from slave-owners who owned their ancestors as a declaration of mental emancipation. This is not considered necessary if the new member has a name that is already African in origin. During the mid-20th century it began encouraging the use of \"X\" as a surname, symbolising what they regarded as African American identity as an \"ex-slave\" and also as a marker for their lost ancestral name. As this results in many individuals having the same name, numbers are added before the X to differentiate members (i.e. \"Charles 2X,\" \"Charles 3X\").\nThe NOI encourages its followers to live highly disciplined lifestyles, revolving around structure and order; these conservative and ascetic approaches have led to followers being called \"Black Puritans.\" They are encouraged to obey the law, to seek gainful employment, to always be punctual, to avoid buying on credit, and to not gamble. It is typical for male members to cut their hair very short, sometimes shaving the head entirely, and to not wear a beard.\nThis signifies their willingness to abide to the strict rules of the organisation and their renunciation of much personal choice. They are expected to wear suits with either ties or bowties; those who are part of the Fruit of Islam guards wear military-style uniforms. Women are commanded to dress modestly; they are not permitted to wear trousers and are encouraged to cover their heads, although the latter is deemed optional.\nThe NOI teaches that practitioners should seek to keep fit and maintain a healthy diet. Vegetarianism is encouraged among members, although not obligatory, with Elijah Muhammad writing that \"meat was never intended for man to eat.\" In \"How to Eat How to Live\", Elijah Muhammad urged his followers to subsist primarily on fruit, vegetables, and certain grains, and to choose lamb if they must eat meat. Discouraged foods include dried fruits, white flour, additives, and fast food. Although its own produce is not wholly organic, the Nation is supportive of organic food and the avoidance of genetically modified crops, insecticides, and pesticides.\nThe NOI also encourages followers to avoid foods associated with the slave culture of the U.S., such as cornbread, catfish, and collard greens, deeming this cuisine to be undignified. Concerned about obesity and diabetes among African Americans, Elijah Muhammad urged his followers to restrict their caloric intake, ideally by eating only one meal a day. He claimed that this would extend the human lifespan and that those who ate only once every 24 hours would live for 150 years and that those who ate once every seven days would live for 1,050 years. Members are also encouraged to conduct regular three-day fasts, and to fast during the daylight for the entirety of December. The NOI also prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other recreational drugs, and has recommended the avoidance of vaccines for children.\nEconomic and educational independence.\nEspousing economic nationalism, the Nation follows the ideas of earlier thinkers like Booker T. Washington and Marcus Garvey in emphasizing the construction of black infrastructure as a means of community empowerment. The Nation has created many companies, including the Salaam restaurant chain, the Shabazz bakeries, the Fashahnn Islamic clothing range, the Clean 'N Fresh skin and haircare products, Abundant Life Clinics, and in Chicago it owns a mall.\nIt owns various clothing stores and food markets. Since the 1980s, it has also sought government contracts, and in 1988, it established the Security Agency Incorporated, which provided FOI patrols for clients. In 1985 it launched its POWER (People Organized and Working for Economic Rebirth) project, designed to redirect black purchasing power toward black-owned businesses. It also seeks the collective economic advancement of African Americans through individual achievement; various women members created their own businesses, sometimes run from the home.\nSome of its African American left-wing, anti-capitalist critics have derisively dismissed the Nation's approach to economics as black capitalism; Farrakhan has responded that while socialism appeals to him, capitalism is the only feasible road to economic empowerment for African Americans.\nThe Nation prioritises land ownership to increase food production and autonomy for African Americans; a commonly used slogan among the NOI is that \"The farm is the engine of our national life.\" By the early 1970s, it had 20,000 acres of farm land in Michigan, Alabama, and Georgia, while in 1994 Farrakhan's Nation purchased 1,556 acres of rural South Georgia near Bronwood, naming it Muhammad Farms. Much of the produce grown here is distributed to NOI mosques around the country. NOI members also own urban gardens in various U.S. cities.\nIn 1991, the Nation launched its Three Year Economic Savings Plan, asking followers to send them $10 a month over the three years, money that would collectively allow the group to buy more farmland. For the Nation, acquiring land and growing food is regarded as a means of building self-determination for African Americans. It hopes to establish a system of black-owned farms through which to feed 40 million black people, with the stated aim of providing at least one healthy meal a day for every African American.\nThe NOI is highly critical of the U.S. school system, believing that, by being Eurocentric in its focus and concealing the achievement of non-white societies, it perpetuates white supremacy. To this end, the Nation has established its own educational system. Across the U.S. it has established Muhammad Universities of Islam; most of these are elementary schools, although a few also offer secondary education. These emphasize science, mathematics, black history, Arabic, and NOI doctrine;\nFarrakhan has said that they need to provide black children with \"an education to make them Gods.\" In these schools, boys and girls are taught separately; pupils are only given two weeks of vacation each year. Combating the idea that academic achievement entails \"acting white,\" the Nation has sought to associate hard work in school with pride in being black. As well as African American pupils, some of these schools have also accepted students from Latino, Asian, and Pacific Island communities.\nCivic engagement.\nThe Nation also has a longstanding record of involvement in civic, economic, and political activities outside the strictly religious arena. In some economically deprived areas, they have played a role in providing services that the public institutions have not. In some areas with high African American populations, it has for instance engaged in door-to-door campaigns to raise awareness about local pollution, or used the FOI to patrol neighborhoods as a community watchdog, especially to stop drug-dealing. The Nation has also urged African Americans not to rely on state welfare payments, arguing that this undermines the community's ability to be self-sufficient.\nEdward E. Curtis IV stated that the Nation is \"both highly religious and political at the same time\", while Gardell noted that it \"formulated emphatic political demands\". However, the NOI has urged its members to avoid mainstream electoral politics; in 1961, it was observed that its members rarely voted. Elijah Muhammad refused to support any African Americans campaigning for election, although Louis Farrakhan backed Jesse Jackson's 1984 campaign to become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, and in 1990 three NOI candidates stood for election in the U.S.\nMany people have presumed the NOI to be a revolutionary movement, however, it has not sought to foment political revolution or violent social change, instead focusing its emphasis on shifting the consciousness of its members, encouraging them to focus on personal moral improvement, family building, and economic activity. Its members avoided involvement in the race riots of the 1960s.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIslam had a presence in North America prior to the formation of the United States. African Muslims were among the Spanish expeditions that explored the continent during the early modern period, and were also among the many enslaved people transported there via the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries. It is estimated that, at the time of the American Revolution in the 1760s\u201380s, approximately 15 percent of enslaved Africans and African Americans in the new United States were Muslim. Although Islam probably died out among the African American community over subsequent generations, the notion that Islam was a religion historically associated with African Americans influenced the emergence of groups like the NOI in the early 20th century.\nThe early NOI's theology was informed by various sources, including older forms of black nationalism, Garveyism, the Moorish Science Temple of America, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and Black Freemasonry. The Nation was significantly influenced by Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican-born black nationalist who lived in the U.S. from 1916 to 1927, and who formed the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA); Zoe Coley commented that \"UNIA provided the cultural bedrock for the NOI\". Garvey's economic nationalism, whereby he called for African American economic self-sufficiency and enterprise, was a particular influence.\nThe Moorish Science Temple, an organization also promoting an idiosyncratic religion that described its teachings as Islam, would also be a key influence on the Nation. This had been established by the North Carolina-born African American Noble Drew Ali in Newark, New Jersey, in 1913. Drew Ali claimed that he was the reincarnation of both Jesus and Muhammad, and maintained that African Americans should refer to themselves as \"Moorish Americans,\" reflecting what he believed were their connections to the Islamic Moors of North Africa. The Nation then emerged in the context of the 1930s, when large numbers of African Americans were migrating from southern states to the cities of the north; most of its early members were southern migrants who had settled in Detroit.\nWallace Fard Muhammad.\nThe Nation of Islam was founded by Wallace Fard Muhammad, who appeared in Detroit in July 1930, when he began preaching his ideas among the city's African Americans. Fard Muhammad claimed that he was an Arab from Mecca who had come to the United States on a mission to the African American people, whom he called the \"Nation of Islam,\" to restore them to their original faith. The Nation has since taught that he was born in Mecca on February 26, 1877, the son of a black father and white mother; in their view, he was Allah himself.\nOutside of the Nation, various theories have been proposed as to the true identity of Fard Muhammad. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later noted that Fard Muhammad's fingerprints matched those of Wallie D. Ford, a white man who had a record of arrests and had served a three-year sentence in San Quentin Prison for drugs charges. Ford had been released in May 1929, a year before the appearance of Fard Muhammad. The NOI reject the identification of Fard Muhammad as Ford, claiming that the FBI forged the fingerprint evidence. Another allegation is that Fard had been a member of the Moorish Science Temple of America, David Ford-el, and had tried to claim its leadership by proclaiming himself to be the reincarnation of founder Noble Drew Ali but failed.\nFard Muhammad's following grew rapidly. Around 7000 to 8000 people attended his meetings, which were held three days a week. Some of those attracted to it had previously been members of the Moorish Science Temple. He wrote two manuals, the \"Secret Ritual of the Nation of Islam\" and the \"Teaching for the Lost Found Nation of Islam in a Mathematical Way\". He also urged his followers to listen to the radio sermons of the Watch Tower Society and Baptist fundamentalists. He established a bureaucratic administration within the Nation, its own system of schools, and the Fruit of Islam (FOI) paramilitary wing for men and the Muslim Girls Training School for women.\nIn 1931, an African American man named Elijah Poole became a disciple of Fard Muhammad. He had been born to a poor family in Bold Springs, Georgia in 1897; his father was a sharecropper and Baptist preacher. In 1923, Poole and his wife Clara relocated to Detroit, where they settled in the black ghetto of Paradise Valley. There, he joined Garvey's UNIA, and worked in industrial plants before becoming unemployed amid the Great Depression. On joining the Nation of Islam, Fard Muhammad gave Poole the new name of Elijah Karriem.\nIn 1932 the Detroit Police Department arrested an NOI member for a murder which they claimed was a human sacrifice. This led to headline news which often identified the NOI as a \"Voodoo cult\". The police then raided the Nation's headquarters and arrested Fard Muhammad. He was soon released; the killer was declared insane. After this incident, Fard Muhammad gave Elijah Poole increasing powers, declaring him Supreme Minister of the Nation and renaming him Elijah Muhammad. In 1933, Elijah Muhammad then set up a new temple on Chicago's South Side. Fard Muhammad was arrested several further times; in September 1933 he was arrested for disorderly conduct in Chicago, which is his last known verified whereabouts. In 1934, Fard Muhammad disappeared without notifying his followers or designating a successor. Rumours spread that he had moved to Europe or that he had been killed, either by the police or by ex-followers of his.\nElijah Muhammad's leadership.\nWith Fard Muhammad gone, Elijah Muhammad took over as head of the Nation. It was under his leadership \"that the NOI's theology crystallized\". Elijah Muhammad claimed that Fard Muhammad had been the latest Allah and that he had now returned to his own realm, with Elijah Muhammad remaining on Earth as his messenger. His wife Clara took on the identity of Khadija. Under Elijah Muhammad's leadership, the NOI relocated its headquarters to Chicago. He then spent the following seven years traveling around the United States, mostly along the East Coast, promoting his religion to African Americans. Under his leadership, the Nation grew in size and influence.\nDuring the Second World War, the FBI started monitoring the Nation; FBI informants reported pro-Japanese sentiment being expressed at its meetings. Many Nation members refused the military draft, and in September 1942, the FBI arrested 65 NOI members, including Elijah Muhammad, who was incarcerated for refusing to register for the draft. He was released in August 1946, at which point he found the Nation's membership had declined. He lived at a villa named The Palace in Chicago's Hyde Park area, and in winter moved to a large ranch outside Phoenix, Arizona. Increasingly exposed to Sunni Islam, Elijah Muhammad drew more elements from it into the Nation, and also undertook the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca three times, in 1959, 1967, and 1971.\nDuring the latter part of the 1950s, the group's membership grew. In 1959, the FBI encouraged the media to attack the Nation, hoping to discredit it. It was in this year that a documentary about the group, \"The Hate that Hate Produced\", was screened. This press criticism backfired, giving the group significant attention and assisting its recruitment. The NOI became a foil for the civil rights movement, which presented the group as evidence for the harmful effect that poor race relations were having in the U.S. In 1962, Los Angeles police raided one of the Nation's temples; one member was killed and seven injured, attracting national press attention. In 1963, a schism in the Nation's Temple Number 7 in Harlem led to the creation of a new group, the Five Percent Nation of Islam.\nOne of the Nation's most significant members at this time was Malcolm X. Born Malcolm Little, he discovered the Nation while in prison; following his release in 1952 he rose swiftly through its hierarchy. In 1960, he launched the newspaper \"Muhammad Speaks\", which reached a circulation of over 600,000. In 1963, he became the Nation's first National Representative. He also travelled internationally; in Britain, he met with Michael de Freitas, who converted to the Nation and created a British branch. Another prominent NOI member was the boxer Muhammad Ali. Born Cassius Clay, he encountered the Nation in 1961 and received significant media criticism after announcing his membership of the group in 1964.\nMalcolm X went on the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, where he came across white Muslims, an experience that shifted him from his total hostility to white people. Immediately prior to this, he also began ideologically distancing himself from NOI by declaring Black Nationalism his political philosophy. This was directly in violation of Elijah Muhammad's vision, in which the Nation was apolitical. In light of these experiences, in March 1964 he left the Nation and became a Sunni Muslim. He began denouncing Elijah Muhammad for his extramarital affairs and accused the Nation of holding back the revolutionary potential of African Americans. In February 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated in New York. The following year, three members of the NOI were convicted of the killing. There was press speculation that the Nation's leaders were complicit, something which damaged the group's reputation; recruitment declined in the latter half of the 1960s. As the Black Power movement emerged in the late 1960s, many observers saw the Nation as its forerunner and a vanguard, with the Nation claiming that it had inspired the movement.\nIn 1972, the NOI bought the St. Constantine Greek Orthodox Church in Chicago and transformed it into their headquarters temple, Mosque Maryam, and by 1974 it had either temples or study groups in every U.S. state and the District of Columbia. Relations with law enforcement remained strained; in 1972, a New York City policeman was shot and killed during a search of a NOI Mosque in Harlem. It had continued to face opposition from the FBI, who engaged in a renewed counterintelligence project to destabilise it from the late 1960s. This included sowing discord between the Nation and the Black Panther Party, encouraging several incidents in which Black Panthers attacked NOI newspaper sellers.\nThe NOI also engaged in recurring conflicts with other Islamic groups that had predominantly black memberships. It argued with Hamaas Abdul Khaalis' Hanafi Muslim group, and in 1973 a group of Nation of Islam members killed seven Hanafi Muslims, five of them children. The Nation's leadership denied sanctioning this attack.\nWallace Muhammad and the NOI's transition to Sunni Islam.\nIn 1975, Elijah Muhammad died and was succeeded by his son, Wallace Muhammad. Wallace Muhammad had had a strained relationship with his father and his father's teachings; while imprisoned in the early 1960s he had moved closer to Sunni Islam and had left the Nation on several occasions during the 1960s and 1970s, having re-joined in 1974. As leader, Wallace Muhammad launched what he called a \"Second Resurrection\" in the movement.\nHe increasingly aligned the group with Sunni Islam, rejecting many of the Nation's idiosyncratic teachings, including its claim that Fard was God, that Elijah Muhammad had been a prophet, the Myth of Yakub, and the claims about the Mother Plane. He retained the Nation's themes of black pride, healthy diets, sexual modesty, and economic self-determination. \"Temples\" were renamed \"mosques,\" while \"ministers\" were renamed \"imams.\" The FOI was disbanded, with Wallace calling it a \"hooligan outfit.\" Black nationalism was abandoned, and the ban on white people joining the Nation was lifted.\nIn November 1976, the Nation was renamed the World Community of al-Islam in the West, and in April 1978, it was renamed the American Muslim Mission. Wallace Muhammad also renamed himself, first to Warith Deen and then to Warithuddin Muhammad. Wallace Muhammad claimed that these changes were in accordance with his father's intentions; he claimed to be in contact with Fard Muhammad, and that the founder had established the NOI's idiosyncratic beliefs as a means of gradually introducing Islamic teachings to African Americans, with the ultimate intention of bringing them to mainstream Sunni Islam.\nHe claimed that the Nation's old belief that the white man was the Devil referred to mental whiteness, a state that is rebelling against Allah, rather than light-skinned people themselves. Most mosques remained with Wallace Muhammad during these reforms but some mosques rejected them, seeking to return to the group's original teachings; small splinter groups emerged in Detroit, Atlanta, and Baltimore. In 1985, Wallace Muhammad disbanded the organization, telling his followers to affiliate instead with their local mosques.\nLouis Farrakhan's revival.\nThe leading figure in rejecting Wallace Muhammad's reforms was Louis Farrakhan, who, with other disaffected members began to rebuild the Nation of Islam in 1977. Born in the Bronx to Caribbean migrants, Farrakhan had been a nightclub singer prior to joining the original Nation in 1955. In 1964 he had become minister of the NOI's Harlem Temple and in 1967 a national representative of Elijah Muhammad. Under Wallace Muhammad's leadership, Farrakhan was relocated to Chicago, widely seen as a demotion.\nFarrakhan presented himself as Elijah Muhammad's true successor; his followers described Wallace Muhammad's leadership as \"the Fall.\" Farrakhan's NOI spent the first several years focusing on rebuilding; the Fruit of Islam was re-established. In 1979, Farrakhan established a newspaper, \"The Final Call\", which by 1994 had a circulation of 500,000. In 1981, Farrakhan's Nation held its first convention, and its membership began to increase rapidly in the mid-1980s. It was able to buy much of the property owned by its predecessor, including the Chicago Palace and the Stoney Island Mosque.\nFarrakhan claimed that in 1985, at Tepotzotl\u00e1n in Mexico, he was teleported aboard the Mother Plane and there was given advice on the future of the Nation. Masonic elements and numerology came to play an important part in Farrakhan's speeches. Farrakhan's Nation expanded its international network, including building links in Africa; particularly strong links were built between Farrakhan and Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings. Under Farrakhan, the NOI adopted more elements of mainstream Islamic practice, although not to the extent of Wallace Muhammad.\nAlthough Farrakhan was critical of the heavy use of themes such as sex, violence, and drugs in rap and hip hop music, during the 1980s and 1990s artists influenced by the Nation who were active in these genres played a role in spreading the Nation's message. Farrakhan had grown concerned by the growth of gang violence, especially among African American youths, and in 1989 launched his \"Stop the Killing\" campaign to combat it. He played a key role in getting two of the country's largest gangs, the Bloods and the Crips, to sign a ceasefire in May 1992. Later in the 1990s, Farrakhan's NOI opened its first mosques in Britain.\nFarrakhan organized the Million Man March through Washington DC in 1995 which united a range of African American groups to counter negative portrayals of black manhood; it was the largest black demonstration in U.S. history.\nIn 2010, Farrakhan announced his embrace of Dianetics and has actively encouraged NOI members to undergo auditing from the Church of Scientology. Farrakhan praised L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Dianetics and Scientology, stating that his ideas were \"exceedingly valuable to every Caucasian person on this Earth\". NOI Sister Charlene Muhammad received the \"Dianetics Auditor of the Year\" Award 2018.\nOrganization.\nLeadership and financing.\nFamily ties are an important element of the NOI's senior ranks; various members of Elijah Muhammad's family were for instance married to members of Farrakhan's family.\nAs of 2020, the Nation consisted of ten ministries: for Spiritual Development, Agriculture, Education, Information, Health, Trade and Commerce, Defense, Justice, Arts and Culture, and Science and Technology. It also established a shadow ministry, forming the prototype for the governance of the future state it hopes to lead.\nThe Fruit of Islam is an elite group of men within the NOI, tasked with adhering to its rules more strictly than other members. The FOI members are trained in military protocol, wrestling, boxing, and judo. They are charged with protecting the temples. The Nation has also established Muslim Girls' Training for women, teaching them domestic skills, self defense tactics, and other life skills.\nThe NOI explains that its finances come primarily from donations and its businesses. At the start of the 1960s, it was reported that members were expected to donate a set part of their earnings to the group each year; as of 1952, this reportedly constituted a third of a member's annual income. In 1976, Wallace Muhammad estimated the Nation's net worth to be $46 million, although revealed it had a severe cash flow problem, owed millions in back taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, and was making a loss with its agricultural operations. Although the Nation does not reveal the extent of its financial resources, in the 1990s its assets were estimated to total $80,000,000.\nPress and media.\nFrom its early days, the Nation used print media to promote its ideas, including the magazines \"Muhammad Speaks\" (1961\u201375) and \"The Final Call\". \"Muhammad Speaks\" included contributions not only from Nation members, but also from leftist and progressive writers in the African American community. Members were encouraged to sell these magazines on street corners or sometimes door-to-door in African American-majority areas. These sellers were given sales quotas to fulfil and were sometimes punished if they failed to meet them. The Nation's first magazine aimed at women, \"Righteous Living\", appeared in the early 1990s. As well as running shows on radio stations, and distributing videos, the Nation has also established websites and a presence across many social media outlets.\nDomestic and international affiliations.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, the Nation had links with Satokata Takahashi, a Japanese man who was promoting pro-Japanese sentiment among African American groups. Takahashi lived with an officer of the Nation for a time and also married a former member. Elijah Muhammad declared that Takahashi was teaching African Americans that \"the Japanese were brothers and friends of the American Negroes\". During the Second World War, in which the U.S. fought against Japan, many Nation members expressed pro-Japanese sentiment and refused the draft to fight against the Japanese military, stating that they would not fight people whom they regarded as fellow members of the Original Asiatic Race.\nUnder Elijah Muhammad, the Nation established relations with various Muslim countries, regarded as strategic allies in its conflict with the U.S. government. In 1957, Malcolm X organized a conference on colonialism attended by delegates from Egypt, Iraq, Sudan, and Morocco, while Elijah Muhammad met with Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1959 and the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1972. On taking control, Farrakhan also pursued links with various Muslim-majority countries, visiting Ghana and Libya in 1985. For many years, Gaddafi was the Nation's most prominent international supporter and offered them assistance in various forms. His government gave the Nation a $3 million interest-free loan in 1972 to purchase its Chicago South Side centre, and another $5 million interest-free loan in 1985 to fund its black enterprise program. It later offered Farrakhan's Nation $1 billion, which the U.S. government sought to block. In 1996, Farrakhan embarked on a tour of Africa and the Middle East, meeting with leaders including Gaddafi, Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, Nigeria's Sani Abacha, South Africa's Nelson Mandela, and Iraq's Saddam Hussein. On that tour, he also attended annual celebrations of the Iranian Revolution in Tehran; he visited Iran again in 2018.\nLike Garvey's UNIA before them, the Nation has also built links with white nationalist and other far-right white groups on the basis of their shared belief in racial separatism. Malcolm X revealed that the Nation had held meetings with representatives of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and the American Nazi Party (ANP). The ANP's leader George Lincoln Rockwell attended an NOI rally in Washington DC in 1961 and then spoke at the Nation's St Saviour's Day rally in Chicago in 1962. Links with the white far-right continued under Farrakhan's Nation, with Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance donating money to the Nation in 1985 and expressing approval of its separatist aims. During the 1980s, the Nation also had a supportive relationship with the British National Front as the latter's Strasserite leadership were endorsing a united front against multi-racial society. During the 1990s, the Nation collaborated with members of the far-right LaRouche movement as part of their shared opposition to the U.S.-led Gulf War. These links have not prevented some white far-right opposition to the NOI; in 1993 the Fourth Reich Skinheads were revealed to have plotted to kill Farrakhan.\nConversion and demographics.\nSince its early years, the NOI has sought to recruit disenfranchised African American Christians, and unemployed, disenchanted black youth. Its process of seeking converts is termed \"fishing for the dead.\" To this end, the Nation holds regular open meetings, mass rallies, street-corner lectures, and prison outreach. Young \"brothers\" seek new recruits in \"jails and penitentiaries, pool halls and barbershops, college campuses and street corners.\" It has also utilized books by Elijah Muhammad, radio broadcasts, and audio-recorded speeches to promote its message.\nIn its early decades, the Nation's appeal was strongest in poor African American neighborhoods. Colley thought that in these areas, it offered men living in poverty the \"opportunity to reclaim their manhood and sense of pride\", thus partly explaining its appeal. Although originating as a largely lower-class movement, over the course of the 20th century it became increasingly middle-class. Gardell suggested that this was partly due to the Nation's focus on hard work and rigid morality, which helped improve the economic situation of its members, coupled with the broader growth of the African American middle-class in this period. He also believed that the changing class composition, and with it a less hostile attitude to white-dominant American society, assisted the shift to Sunnism under Wallace Muhammad in the 1970s.\nThe group's recruitment efforts have proved particularly effective among drug addicts and incarcerated criminals, operating in areas where the African American Christian churches lack a strong presence. The Nation was active in prison ministry by the 1950s, with its numbers of imprisoned followers rising steadily in the latter part of that decade; many of its members, including Malcolm X, were recruited while in prison. Farrakhan stepped up the Nation's prison ministry in the 1980s in response to the increasing incarceration of young black men under the Reagan administration. By the early 1960s, prison authorities were raising concerns that the NOI was exacerbating racial tensions in prisons; the availability of NOI material in prisons has raised concerns in the U.S. government, with Peter King and Frank Wolf expressing concern about its potential role in the radicalization of inmates. Some incarcerated members have claimed to have experienced discriminatory treatment from prison authorities because of their religion.\nPrior to 1975, only a small number of Hispanic American and Native American individuals were members of the NOI, although under Farrakhan the Nation began putting greater efforts into recruiting among these groups. The number of Latinos in the Nation is not known, although their presence in the group is much higher under Farrakhan than it was under Elijah Muhammad.\nNot all members are likely to believe every teaching of the Nation implicitly, and there are reports of members who privately break the Nation's rules, for instance by listening to jazz records and smoking marijuana.\nThe Nation does not publicly reveal its membership numbers, and in the past it had a high turnover among its members, some eventually evolving into becoming conventional Sunni Muslims. Under Fard Muhammad's leadership, it reached a total of approximately 8000 members. By 1960, its membership was being estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000; in his 1961 study of the group, the scholar C. Eric Lincoln suggested the higher estimate. In 2007, the scholar of religion Lawrence A. Mamiya suggested that there were then around 50,000 members of the Nation. While based in the U.S., the Nation has also established either a presence or influence in all parts of the world where there is a dense clustering of the African diaspora. In 2006, Nuri Tinaz suggested that the Nation \"may have\" up to 2,000 members and sympathisers in the United Kingdom.\nAccusations of prejudice.\nHaving been criticised by both blacks and non-blacks, the Nation has repeatedly been accused of stirring up racial hatred against white people. It has been called a hate group by African American civil rights activists including the NAACP's Roy Wilkins, as well as by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which claims that the NOI teaches a \"theology of innate black superiority over whites\". The Associated Press described the Nation as having, in the past, favored black supremacist views. In a 1993 speech at Kean College, the NOI representative Khalid Abdul Muhammad stated that White South Africans should be given 24 hours to leave their country, and all of those whites who are still in South Africa after that point should be killed; Farrakhan censured him for the tone of this speech. The Nation has also been accused of anti-LGBT rhetoric.\nThe NOI has repeatedly been accused of antisemitism, an accusation that it has denied. Accusations of antisemitism have also been levelled at Malcolm X and Farrakhan. In the 1980s, Farrakhan referred to Judaism as a \"dirty religion\" and described Adolf Hitler as a \"very great man\" who \"raised Germany up from nothing\". He dismissed the claim that the Jews are God's Chosen People as \"ridiculous\", insisting that this role is taken by the black race. At his Kean College speech, Khalid Mohammad had referred to the \"Jew-nited Nations\" in \"Jew York City\" and stated that the Jewish people deserved Hitler.\nIn 1991, the NOI published an anonymously authored book, \"The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews\"; this book generated controversy for arguing that Jews had a disproportionately high level of involvement in the Atlantic slave trade.\nDavid W. Leinweber of Emory University asserts that the Nation of Islam engages in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust, and that they exaggerate the role of Jews in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.\nAccusations of antisemitism have come from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a U.S.-based Jewish organization which has referred to Farrakhan as \"Black Hitler.\" The ADL has engaged in surveillance of the Nation, anti-NOI political lobbying, and attempts to block its enterprises. Farrakhan has stated, \"The ADL\u00a0... uses the term 'anti-Semitism' to stifle all criticism of Zionism and the Zionist policies of the State of Israel and also to stifle all legitimate criticism of the errant behavior of some Jewish people toward the non-Jewish population of the earth.\" Other Jewish groups have also been critical of the NOI; four Jewish organizations withdrew their sponsorship of the Parliament of World Religions when it invited Farrakhan to speak, while Jewish student groups have sought to prevent Farrakhan giving speeches on university campuses, picketing these speeches when they have occurred. Far-right Jewish groups have gone further; the Jewish Defense League organized a \"Death to Farrakhan\" march in 1985, while the Jewish Defense Organization was found to have Farrakhan as the top name on its list of individuals it sought to kill.\nThe NOI Health Minister Abdul Alim Muhammad accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the AIDS virus; in 2020 Ishmael Muhammad claimed that Jewish people were receiving different vaccines for COVID-19 from other people.\nReception and influence.\nThe Nation of Islam became the largest black nationalist organization in the United States, having cultivated a sense of pride among many African Americans and made a noted effort to improve their education and welfare. At the start of the 21st century, Barrett called the NOI \"one of the most visible and controversial black religions,\" while in the 1990s Gardell termed it the \"most renowned and controversial\" of the African American Muslim groups.\nAfrican American studies scholar, Priscilla McCutcheon noted that although the NOI remained a comparatively small religion, it had \"a wide discursive reach\", while in 1996 Gardell commented that its influence among black youth \"far exceeds\" its membership. The Nation's role in confronting gang violence, drugs, and poverty among African American communities has earned them respect. The sociologist A.A. Akom opined that the NOI had a reputation even among non-Muslim African Americans of \"speaking truth to power,\" with a 1994 \"Time\"/CNN poll found that two-thirds of African Americans who knew of Farrakhan had favorable views of him. Similarly positive assessments of the Nation's efforts have been observed among black communities in Britain.\nThe Nation's teachings have influenced other groups, such as the Ansaaru Allah Community, which formed in 1970, and the Word of Faith movement, a type of Christianity which emerged in areas of the U.S. where the NOI had a pre-existing presence. The Nation has also influenced a range of hip hop and rap artists, including Public Enemy, Ice Cube, Kam, The Skinny Boys, Sister Souljah, and Prince Akeem, with various gangsta rap artists supporting the Nation.\nThe NOI has been the subject of much scholarly attention. Initial research was largely undertaken by historians and sociologists in the late 1950s and 1960s and was often hostile or dismissive; research influenced by disciplines like religious studies and gender studies followed later.\nDuring the 20th century, most studies on the NOI relied on secondary sources due to the group's general unwillingness to open itself up to study. Those outside the movement have often seen its teachings as illogical and irrational. Various historical and scientific errors have been identified in the claims of its leaders; mainstream scientists, and much of the wider public, regard its mythological accounts as being pseudo-scientific.\nMainstream Islamic groups maintain that the Nation's members are not really Muslim. This is the view taken by groups like the Federation of Islamic Associations of the United States and Canada, which have distanced themselves from the Nation. The Ahmadiyya, an Islamic group whose legitimacy is also often rejected by mainstream Muslim communities, similarly does not recognise the NOI as Islamic. Elijah Muhammad dismissed these objections by claiming that the \"Old Islam\" of his critics was \"led by white people\", while Farrakhan has responded to such criticisms with his own critique of the mainstream Islamic world, accusing it of racism, of being obedient to the U.S. government, of engaging in sectarian violence, and of excessively relying on the \"hadith\" rather than the Quran. The Nation's views that white people lack inner divinity contrasts with the mainstream Islamic view that all humans are equal under God."}
{"id": "21710", "revid": "266254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21710", "title": "Nerve agent", "text": "Nerve agents, sometimes also called nerve gases, are a class of organic chemicals that disrupt the mechanisms by which nerves transfer messages to organs. The disruption is caused by the blocking of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Nerve agents are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used as poison.\nPoisoning by a nerve agent leads to constriction of pupils, profuse salivation, convulsions, and involuntary urination and defecation, with the first symptoms appearing in seconds after exposure. Death by asphyxiation or cardiac arrest may follow in minutes due to the loss of the body's control over respiratory and other muscles. Some nerve agents are readily vaporized or aerosolized, and the primary portal of entry into the body is the respiratory system. Nerve agents can also be absorbed through the skin, requiring that those likely to be subjected to such agents wear a full body suit in addition to a respirator.\nNerve agents are generally colorless, tasteless liquids that may evaporate to a gas. Agents Sarin and VX are odorless; Tabun has a slightly fruity odor and Soman has a slight camphor odor.\nBiological effects.\nNerve agents attack the nervous system. All such agents function the same way resulting in cholinergic crisis: they inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) in the synapses between nerves that control whether muscle tissues are to relax or contract. If the agent cannot be broken down, muscles are prevented from receiving 'relax' signals and they are effectively paralyzed. It is the compounding of this paralysis throughout the body that quickly leads to more severe complications, including the heart and the muscles used for breathing. Because of this, the first symptoms usually appear within 30 seconds of exposure and death can occur via asphyxiation or cardiac arrest in a few minutes, depending upon the dose received and the agent used.\nInitial symptoms following exposure to nerve agents (like Sarin) are a runny nose, tightness in the chest, and constriction of the pupils. Soon after, the victim will have difficulty breathing and will experience nausea and salivation. As the victim continues to lose control of bodily functions, involuntary salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, \ngastrointestinal pain and vomiting will be experienced. Blisters and burning of the eyes and/or lungs may also occur. This phase is followed by initially myoclonic jerks (muscle jerks) followed by status epilepticus\u2013type epileptic seizure. Death then comes via complete respiratory depression, most likely via the excessive peripheral activity at the neuromuscular junction of the diaphragm.\nThe effects of nerve agents are long lasting and increase with continued exposure. Survivors of nerve agent poisoning almost invariably develop chronic neurological damage and related psychiatric effects. Possible effects that can last at least up to 2\u20133 years after exposure include blurred vision, tiredness, declined memory, hoarse voice, palpitations, sleeplessness, shoulder stiffness and eye strain. In people exposed to nerve agents, serum and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase in the long-term are noticeably lower than normal and tend to be lower the worse the persisting symptoms are.\nMechanism of action.\nWhen a normally functioning motor nerve is stimulated, it releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which transmits the impulse to a muscle or organ. Once the impulse is sent, the enzyme acetylcholinesterase immediately breaks down the acetylcholine in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax.\nNerve agents disrupt the nervous system by inhibiting the function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase by forming a covalent bond with its active site, where acetylcholine would normally be broken down (undergo hydrolysis). Acetylcholine thus builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. This same action also occurs at the gland and organ levels, resulting in uncontrolled drooling, tearing of the eyes (lacrimation) and excess production of mucus from the nose (rhinorrhea).\nThe reaction product of the most important nerve agents, including Soman, Sarin, Tabun and VX, with acetylcholinesterase were solved by the U.S. Army using X-ray crystallography in the 1990s. The reaction products have been confirmed subsequently using different sources of acetylcholinesterase and the closely related target enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase. The X-ray structures clarify important aspects of the reaction mechanism (e.g., stereochemical inversion) at atomic resolution and provide a key tool for antidote development.\nTreatment.\nStandard treatment for nerve agent poisoning is a combination of an anticholinergic to manage the symptoms, and an oxime as an antidote. Anticholinergics treat the symptoms by reducing the effects of acetylcholine, while oximes displaces phosphate molecules from the active site of the cholinesterase enzymes, allowing the breakdown of acetylcholine. Military personnel are issued the combination in an autoinjector (e.g. ATNAA), for ease of use in stressful conditions.\nAtropine is the standard anticholinergic drug used to manage the symptoms of nerve agent poisoning. It acts as an antagonist to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocking the effects of excess acetylcholine. Some synthetic anticholinergics, such as biperiden, may counteract the central symptoms of nerve agent poisoning more effectively than atropine, since they pass the blood\u2013brain barrier better than atropine. While these drugs will save the life of a person affected by nerve agents, that person may be incapacitated briefly or for an extended period, depending on the extent of exposure. The endpoint of atropine administration is the clearing of bronchial secretions.\nPralidoxime chloride (also known as \"2-PAMCl\") is the standard oxime used to treat nerve agent poisoning. Rather than counteracting the initial effects of the nerve agent on the nervous system as does atropine, pralidoxime chloride reactivates the poisoned enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) by scavenging the phosphoryl group attached on the functional hydroxyl group of the enzyme, counteracting the nerve agent itself. Revival of acetylcholinesterase with pralidoxime chloride works more effectively on nicotinic receptors while blocking acetylcholine receptors with atropine is more effective on muscarinic receptors.\nAnticonvulsants, such as diazepam, may be administered to manage seizures, improving long term prognosis and reducing risk of brain damage. This is not usually self-administered as its use is for actively seizing patients.\nCountermeasures.\nPyridostigmine bromide was used by the US military in the first Gulf War as a pretreatment for Soman as it increased the median lethal dose. It is only effective if taken prior to exposure and in conjunction with Atropine and Pralidoxime, issued in the Mark I NAAK autoinjector, and is ineffective against other nerve agents. While it reduces fatality rates, there is an increased risk of brain damage; this can be mitigated by administration of an anticonvulsant. Evidence suggests that the use of pyridostigmine may be responsible for some of the symptoms of Gulf War syndrome.\nButyrylcholinesterase is under development by the U.S. Department of Defense as a prophylactic countermeasure against organophosphate nerve agents. It binds nerve agent in the bloodstream before the poison can exert effects in the nervous system.\nBoth purified acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase have demonstrated success in animal studies as \"biological scavengers\" (and universal targets) to provide stoichiometric protection against the entire spectrum of organophosphate nerve agents. Butyrylcholinesterase currently is the preferred enzyme for development as a pharmaceutical drug primarily because it is a naturally circulating human plasma protein (superior pharmacokinetics) and its larger active site compared with acetylcholinesterase may permit greater flexibility for future design and improvement of butyrylcholinesterase to act as a nerve agent scavenger.\nClasses.\nThere are two main classes of nerve agents. The members of the two classes share similar properties and are given both a common name (such as \"Sarin\") and a two-character NATO identifier (such as GB).\nG-series.\nThe \"G-series\" is thus named because German scientists first synthesized them. G series agents are known as non-persistent, meaning that they evaporate shortly after release, and do not remain active in the dispersal area for very long. All of the compounds in this class were discovered and synthesized during or prior to World War II, led by Gerhard Schrader (later under the employment of IG Farben).\nThis series is the first and oldest family of nerve agents. The first nerve agent ever synthesized was GA (Tabun) in 1936. GB (Sarin) was discovered next in 1939, followed by GD (Soman) in 1944, and finally the more obscure GF (Cyclosarin) in 1949. GB was the only G agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, aerial bombs, and artillery shells.\nV-series.\nThe \"V-series\" is the second family of nerve agents and contains five well known members: VE, VG, VM, VR, and VX, along with several more obscure analogues.\nThe most studied agent in this family, VX (it is thought that the 'X' in its name comes from its overlapping isopropyl radicals), was invented in the 1950s at Porton Down in the United Kingdom. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist at the Plant Protection Laboratories of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was investigating a class of organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols). Like Schrader, Ghosh found that they were quite effective pesticides. In 1954, ICI put one of them on the market under the trade name Amiton. It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not escape military notice and some of the more toxic materials had been sent to the British Armed Forces research facility at Porton Down for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds became a new group of nerve agents, the V agents (depending on the source, the V stands for Victory, Venomous, or Viscous). The best known of these is probably VX, with VR (\"Russian V-gas\") coming a close second (Amiton is largely forgotten as VG, with G probably coming from \"G\"hosh). All of the V-agents are persistent agents, meaning that these agents do not degrade or wash away easily and can therefore remain on clothes and other surfaces for long periods. In use, this allows the V-agents to be used to blanket terrain to guide or curtail the movement of enemy ground forces. The consistency of these agents is similar to oil; as a result, the contact hazard for V-agents is primarily \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 dermal. VX was the only V-series agent that was fielded by the US as a munition, in rockets, artillery shells, airplane spray tanks, and landmines.\nAnalyzing the structure of thirteen V agents, the standard composition, which makes a compound enter this group, is the absence of halides. It is clear that many agricultural pesticides can be considered as V agents if they are notoriously toxic. The agent is not required to be a phosphonate and presents a dialkylaminoethyl group. The toxicity requirement is waived as the VT agent and its salts (VT-1 and VT-2) are \"non-toxic\". Replacing the sulfur atom with selenium increases the toxicity of the agent by orders of magnitude.\nNovichok agents.\nThe Novichok (Russian: , \"newcomer\") agents, a series of organophosphate compounds, were developed in the Soviet Union and in Russia from the mid-1960s to the 1990s. The Novichok program aimed to develop and manufacture highly deadly chemical weapons that were unknown to the West. The new agents were designed to be undetectable by standard NATO chemical-detection equipment and overcome contemporary chemical-protective equipment.\nIn addition to the newly developed \"third generation\" weapons, binary versions of several Soviet agents were developed and were designated as \"Novichok\" agents.\nCarbamates.\nContrary to some claims, not all nerve agents are organophosphates. The starting compound studied by the USA was the carbamate EA-1464, of notorious toxicity. Compounds typified by EA-1464 formed a large group of them are carbamates like EA-3990 and EA-4056, both of which have been claimed to be about 3 times more toxic than VX. Both the USA and the Soviet Union\ndeveloped carbamate nerve agents during the Cold War. They are sometimes grouped as \"fourth generation\" agents along with the Novichok agents due to their falling outside the definitions of controlled substances under the CWC.\nInsecticides.\nSome insecticides, including carbamates and organophosphates such as dichlorvos, malathion and parathion, are nerve agents. The metabolism of insects is sufficiently different from mammals that these compounds have little effect on humans and other mammals at proper doses, but there is considerable concern about the effects of long-term exposure to these chemicals by farm workers and animals alike. At high enough doses, acute toxicity and death can occur through the same mechanism as other nerve agents. Some insecticides such as demeton, dimefox and paraoxon are sufficiently toxic to humans that they have been withdrawn from agricultural use, and were at one stage investigated for potential military applications.\nParaoxon was allegedly used as an assassination weapon by the apartheid South African government as part of Project Coast. Organophosphate pesticide poisoning is a major cause of disability in many developing countries and is often the preferred method of suicide.\nMethods of spreading.\nMany methods exist for spreading nerve agents such as:\nThe method chosen will depend on the physical properties of the nerve agent(s) used, the nature of the target, and the achievable level of sophistication.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nThis first class of nerve agents, the G-series, was accidentally discovered in Germany on December 23, 1936, by a research team headed by Gerhard Schrader working for IG Farben. Since 1934, Schrader had been working in a laboratory in Leverkusen to develop new types of insecticides for IG Farben. While working toward his goal of improved insecticide, Schrader experimented with numerous compounds, eventually leading to the preparation of Tabun.\nIn experiments, Tabun was extremely potent against insects: as little as 5 ppm of Tabun killed all the leaf lice he used in his initial experiment. In January 1937, Schrader observed the effects of nerve agents on human beings first-hand when a drop of Tabun spilled onto a lab bench. Within minutes he and his laboratory assistant began to experience miosis (constriction of the pupils of the eyes), dizziness and severe shortness of breath. It took them three weeks to recover fully.\nIn 1935 the Nazi government had passed a decree that required all inventions of possible military significance to be reported to the Ministry of War, so in May 1937 Schrader sent a sample of Tabun to the chemical warfare (CW) section of the Army Weapons Office in Berlin-Spandau. Schrader was summoned to the Wehrmacht chemical lab in Berlin to give a demonstration, after which Schrader's patent application and all related research was classified as secret. Colonel R\u00fcdiger, head of the CW section, ordered the construction of new laboratories for the further investigation of Tabun and other organophosphate compounds and Schrader soon moved to a new laboratory at Wuppertal-Elberfeld in the Ruhr valley to continue his research in secret throughout World War II. The compound was initially codenamed Le-100 and later Trilon-83.\nSarin was discovered by Schrader and his team in 1938 and named in honor of its discoverers: Gerhard Schrader, Otto Ambros, , and Hans-J\u00fcrgen von der Linde. It was codenamed T-144 or Trilon-46. It was found to be more than ten times as potent as Tabun.\nSoman was discovered by Richard Kuhn in 1944 as he worked with the existing compounds; the name is derived from either the Greek 'to sleep' or the Latin 'to bludgeon'. It was codenamed T-300.\nCycloSarin was also discovered during WWII but the details were lost and it was rediscovered in 1949.\nThe G-series naming system was created by the United States when it uncovered the German activities, labeling Tabun as GA (German Agent A), Sarin as GB and Soman as GD. Ethyl Sarin was tagged GE and CycloSarin as GF.\nDuring World War II.\nIn 1939, a pilot plant for Tabun production was set up at Munster-Lager, on L\u00fcneburg Heath near the German Army proving grounds at . In January 1940, construction began on a secret plant, code named \"Hochwerk\" (\"High factory\"), for the production of Tabun at \"Dyhernfurth an der Oder\" (now Brzeg Dolny in Poland), on the Oder River from Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw) in Silesia.\nThe plant was large, covering an area of and was completely self-contained, synthesizing all intermediates as well as the final product, Tabun. The factory even had an underground plant for filling munitions, which were then stored at Krappitz (now Krapkowice) in Upper Silesia. The plant was operated by , a subsidiary of IG Farben, as were all other chemical weapon agent production plants in Germany at the time.\nBecause of the plant's deep secrecy and the difficult nature of the production process, it took from January 1940 until June 1942 for the plant to become fully operational. Many of Tabun's chemical precursors were so corrosive that reaction chambers not lined with quartz or silver soon became useless. Tabun itself was so hazardous that the final processes had to be performed while enclosed in double glass-lined chambers with a stream of pressurized air circulating between the walls.\nThree thousand German nationals were employed at Hochwerk, all equipped with respirators and clothing constructed of a poly-layered rubber/cloth/rubber sandwich that was destroyed after the tenth wearing. Despite all precautions, there were over 300 accidents before production even began and at least ten workers died during the two and a half years of operation. Some incidents cited in \"A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare\" are as follows:\n and moved, probably to Dzerzhinsk, USSR.\nIn 1940 the German Army Weapons Office ordered the mass production of Sarin for wartime use. A number of pilot plants were built and a high-production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of World War II. Estimates for total Sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500\u00a0kg to 10 tons.\nDuring that time, German intelligence believed that the Allies also knew of these compounds, assuming that because these compounds were not discussed in the Allies' scientific journals information about them was being suppressed. Though Sarin, Tabun and Soman were incorporated into artillery shells, the German government ultimately decided not to use nerve agents against Allied targets. The Allies did not learn of these agents until shells filled with them were captured towards the end of the war. German forces used chemical warfare against partisans during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula in 1942, but did not use any nerve agent.\nThis is detailed in Joseph Borkin's book \"The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben\":\nPost\u2013World War II.\nSince World War II, Iraq's use of mustard gas against Iranian troops and Kurds (Iran\u2013Iraq War of 1980\u20131988) has been the only large-scale use of any chemical weapons. On the scale of the single Kurdish village of Halabja within its own territory, Iraqi forces did expose the populace to some kind of chemical weapons, possibly mustard gas and most likely nerve agents.\nOperatives of the Aum Shinrikyo religious group made and used Sarin several times on other Japanese, most notably the Tokyo subway sarin attack.\nIn the Gulf War, no nerve agents (nor other chemical weapons) were used, but a number of U.S. and UK personnel were exposed to them when the Khamisiyah chemical depot was destroyed. This and the widespread use of anticholinergic drugs as a protective treatment against any possible nerve gas attack have been proposed as a possible cause of Gulf War syndrome.\nSarin gas was deployed in a 2013 attack on Ghouta during the Syrian Civil War, killing several hundred people. Most governments contend that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad deployed the gas; however, the Syrian Government has denied responsibility.\nOn 13 February 2017, the nerve agent VX was used in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, half-brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia.\nOn 4 March 2018, a former Russian agent (who was convicted of high treason but allowed to live in the United Kingdom via a spy swap agreement), Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, who was visiting from Moscow, were both poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury. They survived, and were subsequently released from hospital. In addition, a Wiltshire Police officer, Nick Bailey, was exposed to the substance. He was one of the first to respond to the incident. Twenty-one members of the public received medical treatment following exposure to the nerve agent. Despite this, only Bailey and the Skripals remained in critical condition. On 11 March 2018, Public Health England issued advice for the other people believed to have been in the Mill pub (the location where the attack is believed to have been carried out) or the nearby Zizzi Restaurant. On 12 March 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the substance used was a Novichok nerve agent.\nOn 30 June 2018, two British nationals, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, were poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent of the same kind that was used in the Skripal poisoning, which Rowley had found in a discarded perfume bottle and gifted to Sturgess. Whilst Rowley survived, Sturgess died on 8 July. Metropolitan Police believe that the poisoning was not a targeted attack, but a result of the way the nerve agent was disposed of after the poisoning in Salisbury.\nOcean disposal.\nIn 1972, the United States Congress banned the practice of disposing chemical weapons into the ocean. Thirty-two thousand tons of nerve and mustard agents had already been dumped into the ocean waters off the United States by the U.S. Army, primarily as part of Operation CHASE. According to a 1998 report by William Brankowitz, a deputy project manager in the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, the Army created at least 26 chemical weapons dump sites in the ocean off at least 11 states on both the west and east coasts. Due to poor records, they currently only know the rough whereabouts of half of them.\nThere is currently a lack of scientific data regarding the ecological and health effects of this dumping. In the event of leakage, many nerve agents are soluble in water and would dissolve in a few days, while other substances like sulfur mustard could last longer. There have also been a few incidents of chemical weapons washing ashore or being accidentally retrieved, for example during dredging or trawl fishing operations.\nDetection.\nDetection of gaseous nerve agents.\nThe methods of detecting gaseous nerve agents include but are not limited to the following.\nLaser photoacoustic spectroscopy.\nLaser photoacoustic spectroscopy (LPAS) is a method that has been used to detect nerve agents in the air. In this method, laser light is absorbed by gaseous matter. This causes a heating/cooling cycle and changes in pressure. Sensitive microphones convey sound waves that result from the pressure changes. Scientists at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory engineered an LPAS system that can detect multiple trace amounts of toxic gases in one air sample.\nThis technology contained three lasers modulated to different frequency, each producing a different sound wave tone. The different wavelengths of light were directed into a sensor referred to as the photoacoustic cell. Within the cell were the vapors of different nerve agents. The traces of each nerve agent had a signature effect on the \"loudness\" of the lasers' sound wave tones. Some overlap of nerve agents' effects did occur in the acoustic results. However, it was predicted that specificity would increase as additional lasers with unique wavelengths were added. Yet, too many lasers set to different wavelengths could result in overlap of absorption spectra. Citation LPAS technology can identify gases in parts per billion (ppb) concentrations.\nThe following nerve agent simulants have been identified with this multiwavelength LPAS:\nOther gases and air contaminants identified with LPAS include:\nNon-dispersive infrared.\nNon-dispersive infrared techniques have been reported to be used for gaseous nerve agent detection.\nIR absorption.\nTraditional IR absorption has been reported to detect gaseous nerve agents.\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy.\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been reported to detect gaseous nerve agents."}
{"id": "21711", "revid": "34765295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21711", "title": "Neon Genesis Evangelion", "text": ", also known simply as Evangelion or Eva, is a Japanese mecha anime television series produced by Gainax and animated by Tatsunoko, directed by Hideaki Anno and broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 1995 to March 1996. \"Evangelion\" is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The protagonist is Shinji Ikari, a teenage boy who is recruited by his father Gendo to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine mecha named \"Evangelion\" into combat against beings known as \"Angels\".\nThe series explores the experiences and emotions of Evangelion pilots and members of Nerv as they try to prevent Angels from causing more cataclysms. In the process, they are called upon to understand the ultimate causes of events and the motives for human action. The series has been described as a deconstruction of the mecha genre and it features archetypal imagery derived from Shinto cosmology as well as Jewish and Christian mystical traditions, including Midrashic tales and Kabbalah. The psychoanalytic accounts of human behavior put forward by Freud and Jung are also prominently featured.\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" received critical acclaim but was also subject to controversy. Particular controversy centered on the final two episodes of the series, as the ending was deemed confusing and abstract to many viewers and critics alike. In 1997, Hideaki Anno and Gainax released the feature film \"The End of Evangelion\", which serves as an alternate ending replacing the final two episodes. A series of four films, titled \"Rebuild of Evangelion\", retelling the events of the series with different plot elements and a new ending, were released between 2007 and 2021. The success of the series led to a rebirth of the anime industry, and it has become a cultural icon. Film, manga, home video, and other products in the \"Evangelion\" franchise have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in overseas markets, with related goods selling over by 2007 and \"Evangelion\" pachinko machines generating by 2015.\nPlot.\nIn 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, teenager Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.\nFollowing hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterward, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the remaining fourteen Angels to prevent the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterward. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl Rei Ayanami. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel. They are then joined by the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented but insufferable teenager Asuka Langley S\u014dryu, who is German-Japanese-American. Together, the three of them manage to defeat several Angels. As Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot, he gradually becomes more confident and self-assured. Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they begin to develop confusing feelings for one another, kissing at her provocation.\nAfter being absorbed by an Angel, Shinji breaks free thanks to Eva acting on its own. He is later forced to fight an infected Evangelion Unit-03 and watches its pilot, his friend and classmate Toji Suzuhara, become incapacitated and permanently disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an Angel which attacks her mind and forces her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is \"the third Rei\". Misato forces scientist Ritsuko Akagi to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard, and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei, who was herself created with the DNA of Shinji's mother, Yui Ikari. This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from the rest of the characters. Kaworu Nagisa replaces the catatonic Asuka as the pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final foretold Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to survive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu; the event makes Shinji overridden with guilt.\nAfter the final Angel is defeated, Gendo triggers the \"Human Instrumentality Project\", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged for benevolent purposes, believing that if unified, humanity could finally overcome the loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued mankind. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.\nCharacters.\nHideaki Anno attempted to create characters that reflected parts of his own personality. The characters of \"Evangelion\" struggle with their interpersonal relationships, their personal problems, and traumatic events in their past. The human qualities of the characters have enabled some viewers of the show to identify with the characters on a personal level, while others interpret them as historical, religious, or philosophical symbols.\nShinji Ikari is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. After witnessing his mother Yui Ikari's death as a child, Shinji was abandoned by his father, Gendo Ikari. He is emotionally hypersensitive and sometimes does as expected out of fear of rejection, but he has often rebelled and refused to pilot the Eva because of the excruciating harm that has been done to him or to his friends. Throughout the series, he says to himself \"I mustn't run away\" as a means of encouraging himself to face the threats of the day, and this sometimes actually gives him bravery in battle, but he has a lingering habit of withdrawing in response to traumatic events. Anno has described Shinji as a boy who \"shrinks from human contact\" and has \"convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person\".\nThe withdrawn and mysterious pilot of Evangelion Unit-00, Rei Ayanami, is a clone made from the salvaged remains of Yui and is plagued by a sense of negative self-worth stemming from the realization that she is an expendable asset. She at first despises Shinji for his lack of trust in his father Gendo, with whom Rei is very close. However, after Shinji and Rei successfully defeat the Angel Ramiel, she takes a friendly liking to him. Towards the end of the series, it is revealed that she is one of many clones, whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei if she is killed.\nAsuka Langley Soryu is a child prodigy who pilots Evangelion Unit-02 and possesses a fiery temper and an overabundance of pride and self-confidence, which often gets her in trouble and difficulty, especially during battles. As a little girl, Asuka discovered the body of her mother shortly after she committed suicide, leading the child to repress her emotions and vow never to cry. Asuka and Shinji develop intense but ambiguous feelings towards each other having difficulty reaching out to others. Their relationship was initially modeled on the one between Jean, Nadia's love interest and eventual husband in the earlier \"\". Similarly to Shinji, Asuka and Rei are presented with their own flaws and difficulty relating to other people.\nMisato Katsuragi is the caretaker and commanding officer for Shinji and Asuka. Her professional demeanor at Nerv contrasts dramatically with her carefree and irresponsible behavior at home. Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto conceived her as an older \"girl next door\" and promiscuous loser who failed to take life seriously. Hideaki Anno described Shinji and Misato as \"afraid of being hurt\" and \"unsuitable\u2014lacking the positive attitude\u2014for what people call heroes of an adventure.\"\nThe teenaged Evangelion pilots are ordered into battle by the steely Gendo Ikari, Shinji's father and the commander of Nerv. He abandoned Shinji and recalled him only to serve as an Evangelion pilot. Gendo salvaged the remains of his dead wife's body to create Rei, whom he viewed as a mere tool at his disposal to defeat the Angels and enact Instrumentality. Similar to Shinji, he is somewhat asocial and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such, often committing immoralities in the process. This fear is also what drove him to abandon Shinji. He is depicted as relentless in his drive to win, a man who \"takes drastic and extreme measures, by fair means or foul, or by hook or by crook, in order to accomplish his own purpose.\" According to Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the characters of Gendo and Fuyutsuki are based on Ed Straker and Alec Freeman of the television series \"UFO\". Sadamoto designed the visual appearance of the characters so that their personalities \"could be understood more or less at a glance\". The distinctive aesthetic appeal of the female lead characters' designs contributed to the high sales of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" merchandise. The design of Rei, in particular, became so popular that the media referred to the character as \"Premium Girl\" due to the high sales of books with Rei on the cover.\nProduction.\nDirector Hideaki Anno fell into a depression following completion of work on ' and the 1992 failure of the ' sequel project. According to Yasuhiro Takeda, Anno agreed to a collaboration between King Records and Gainax while drinking with King representative Toshimichi \u014ctsuki; King Records guaranteed Anno a time slot for \"something, anything\". Anno began the development of the new series in 1993 around the notion of not running away, which had been the underlying theme of \"Aoki Uru\", an earlier Anno project that had failed to move into production. Early into the production, Anno stated his intent to have \"Evangelion\" increase the number of otaku (anime fans) and attract interest in the medium. According to him, the plot of the series reflects his four-year depression. In the early design phase of the \"Evangelion\" project, several formats were considered, including a film, a television series and an original video animation (OVA) series. The producers finally opted for the television series as it was the most widely accessible media in Japan at that time. The proposed title \"Alcion\" was rejected due to its lack of hard consonant sounds.\nCritics noted how \"Evangelion\" borrowed certain scenarios and the use of introspection as a narrative device from a previous Anno project entitled \"Gunbuster\", as he incorporated the narrative structure of \"Nadia\" and multiple frames of reference, leaving the story open to interpretation. Over the course of the writing process, elements of the \"Evangelion\" storyline evolved from the original concept. A female protagonist was initially proposed for the series, but the idea was scrapped. Originally, the first episode presented the battle between an Angel and Rei, while the character of Shinji was only introduced after the Angel had been temporarily defeated. Further changes to the plot were made following the Aum Shinrikyo sect's sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March. Azuma Hiroki has said that the original \"Evangelion\" story was \"too close to reality\" from Anno's point of view. Basically, Anno thought that the original scenario was not suitable for broadcasting, and he feared censorship. However, he also criticized Aum Shinrikyo, because \"they lost any contact with reality\". For this reason, Azuma stated that \"Evangelion\" \"is an intrinsic critique of Aum\". The final version of the story reflects inspiration drawn from numerous other anime and fictional works. Chief among these are \"Space Battleship Yamato\", \"Mobile Suit Gundam\", \"Devilman\" and \"Space Runaway Ideon\". The series also incorporates tributes to \"Childhood's End\", the novels of Ry\u016b Murakami, \"The Andromeda Strain\", \"The Divine Invasion\", the poem \"Pippa Passes\", \"The Hitcher\", and several television series including \"The Prisoner\", \"Thunderbirds\", \"Ultraman\" and \"Ultra Seven\".\nThe development of the \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" series ran close to deadlines throughout its production run. The initial cuts of the first two episodes were screened at the second Gainax festival in July 1995, only three months before they were aired on television. By episode 13 the series began to deviate significantly from the original story, and the initial project was abandoned. The number of Angels was reduced to 17 instead of the original 28, and the writers changed the story's ending, which had originally described the failure of the Human Instrumentality Project after an Angel attack from the moon. Not only did the series suffer from scheduling issues, but according to Anno, despite Gainax being the lead studio for the series, the company itself had inadequate materials and staff for the full production of the series. Only three staff members from Gainax were working on the series at any given time, and the majority of the series' production was outsourced to Tatsunoko Production.\nStarting with episode 16, the show changed drastically, discarding the grand narrative concerning salvation for a narrative focusing on the individual characters. This change coincided with Anno's development of an interest in psychology after a friend lent him a book on mental illness. This focus culminated in a psychoanalysis of the characters in the two final episodes. Necessity forced Anno to abandon the script of the twenty-fifth episode to work with a new one. These episodes feature heavy use of abstract animation, flashbacks, simple line drawings, photographs and fixed image scenes with voice-over dialogue. Some critics speculated that these unconventional animation choices resulted from budget cuts, but Toshio Okada stated that while it wasn't only a problem of schedule or budget, Anno \"couldn't decide the ending until the time came, that's his style\". These two episodes sparked controversy and condemnation among fans and critics of the series. In 1997, Hideaki Anno and Gainax released two animated feature films, providing another ending for the show: \"\" and \"The End of Evangelion\".\nThemes.\nReferences to mystical traditions in Judaism and Christianity, including Midrashic literature and Kabbalah are threaded liberally through the series. Complicating viewers' attempts to form an unambiguous interpretation, the series reworks Midrash stories, Zohar images and other Kabbalistic ideas developed from the Book of Genesis to create a new \"Evangelion\"-specific mythology. Assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki said the religious visual references were intended to make the series more \"interesting\" and \"exotic\", denying the existence of a religious meaning for the use of Christian visual symbols in the show. According to Anno, \"as the symbols are mixed together, for the first time something like an interrelationship or a meaning emerges\". The plot combines elements of esotericism and mysticism of the Jewish Kabbalah, including the Angels, which have common and individual features with the Angels of the religious tradition, such as Sachiel, Sandalphon and Ramiel.\nAccording to Patrick Drazen, numerous allusions to the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihongi\" have a prominent role in \"Evangelion\", along with the Shinto vision of the primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, and the Tree of Life. The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project at the end of the series has been compared to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni, Japanese demons or ogres.\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" has been interpreted as a deeply personal expression of Hideaki Anno's own emotional struggles with depression. During the production of the series, he became interested in mental illness and psychology. According to him, Rei is a schizophrenic character and a representation of Shinji's unconscious, while Shinji has an Oedipus complex and is characterized by a libido-destrudo conflict. Similarly, Ritsuko has an Electra complex, in which she loves Gendo, a sort of substitute for her father figure. Anno himself stated that he identifies with Shinji in both a conscious and unconscious manner, while Rei is Anno's \"deepest part\" and Kaworu his Jungian shadow. Shinji's entering into Unit-01 has been interpreted as a Freudian \"return to the womb\", and his struggle to be free of the Eva as his \"rite of passage\" into manhood. The series also contains references to philosophical and psychoanalytic concepts, such as the oral stage, introjection, oral personality, ambivalence, and the death drive, including elements of the works of Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schopenhauer, and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.\nRelated media.\nFilms.\nIn May 1996, Gainax announced an \"Evangelion\" film in response to fan dissatisfaction with the series finale. On March 15, 1997, Gainax released \"Evangelion: Death &amp; Rebirth\", consisting of 60 minutes of clips taken from the first 24 episodes of the series and the first 30 minutes of the new ending due to production issues. The second film, \"The End of Evangelion\", which premiered on July 19, 1997, provided the complete new ending as a retelling of the final two episodes of the television series. Rather than depicting the series' climax within the characters' minds, the film provides a more conventional, action-based resolution to the series' plot lines. The film won numerous awards and grossed 1.45\u00a0billion yen within six months of its release. Ex.org ranked the film in 1999 as the fifth best 'All-Time Show', with the television series at #2. In 2009, CUT Magazine ranked it the third greatest anime film of all time. In July 1998, the films were re-released as \"\" which combined \"Death(true)\u00b2\" (the director's cut of \"Death\") with \"The End of Evangelion\".\nA new animated film series called \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" by Gainax was made, consisting of four movies. The first film retells the first six episodes from the series but from the second film onward the story is different, including new characters, Evas and Angels. The first film, ', was released in Japan on September 1, 2007, with ' released on June 27, 2009, and ' released on November 17, 2012. The final film, titled ', was released on March 8, 2021, after two delays. In 2015, \"Evangelion:Another Impact\", a 3D-rendered short film collaboration between the Khara studio and the media company Dwango was directed by Shinji Aramaki, released and streamed as number 12 anime short from the Japan Animator Expo on February 8. It depicts \"the story of an Evangelion's activation, rampage and howling in another world\".\nManga and books.\nTen months prior to the television broadcast of \"Evangelion\", the character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto illustrated a manga version of the story, initially a supplement meant to promote the anime series. The first installment of the manga was published in the February issue of \"Sh\u014dnen Ace\" in December 1994 with subsequent installments produced on an irregular basis over an eighteen-year period. The final installment was published in June 2013. Several publishers were initially concerned at the selection of Sadamoto to develop the manga adaptation, viewing him as \"too pass\u00e9 to be bankable\". These concerns proved unfounded upon the strong commercial success of the manga: the first 10 volumes sold over 15\u00a0million copies, and the eleventh volume reached number one on the Tohan charts, selling an additional two million copies. The manga series won the 1996 \"Comicker\" fan manga poll. The story has been adapted into several other manga series in addition to the original Sadamoto project: ', a mystery story that omits the Evangelion units, and ', a parody series which received its own original net animation serial show.\nSoundtracks and music.\nShir\u014d Sagisu composed most of the original music for the series. The soundtracks released to high rankings on the Oricon charts, with \"Neon Genesis Evangelion III\" reaching the number one slot for highest sales in 1997; that same year, Sagisu received the Kobe Animation award for \"Best Music Score\" for his work on \"Evangelion\". Classical music by Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, Giuseppe Verdi and George Frideric Handel were also featured throughout the series and the movies. Additional classical works and original symphonic compositions were used to score later movies produced within the \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" franchise. In total, the series' discography includes 21 full studio, live, compilation and soundtrack albums and six CD singles. The series' opening theme is \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\", performed by Yoko Takahashi. It ranked on two TV Asahi polls, reaching #55 for best anime theme songs of all time, and #18 for best anime theme songs of the 1990s. Fifteen years after its release, the theme won JASRAC's annual award for the royalties it continues to generate from its usage in pachinko, pachislo, karaoke and other venues. The end theme of the series was a version of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" arranged and sung by Claire Littley.\nVideo games.\nSeveral video games based on the series have been developed, ranging from RPG and adventure games to mahjong and card games. The series has also spawned visual novels, two of them inspired the romance and comedy-focused manga series ' and '.\nReleases.\nJapan.\nThe original home video releases in Japan included VHS and Laserdisc sets using a release structured around \"Genesis 0:(volume number)\", with each of the first 12 releases containing two episodes each. Each of the episodes received minor changes and Episodes 21\u201324 were extended with new scenes. \"Genesis 0:13\" and \"Genesis 0:14\" contained the original and the alternate versions of episodes 25 and 26 first presented in \"\". A fifteenth and final release for Laserdisc, entitled \"Genesis 0:X\", contained the broadcast versions of episodes 21 to 24 and was a special mail-in offer for fans who purchased all 14 discs. The first Japanese DVD release was spread across seven volumes; all contained four episodes with the seventh volume containing both the original and alternate versions of episodes 25 and 26. This version was identical to the previous laserdisc and VHS release. The movies were also released as a special set, just like before. In 2000 and 2001, three box sets were released to commemorate the fictional \"Second Impact\" which occurred in the year 2000 in the series. The \"Second Impact Box\" contained the 26 original episodes and both movies on 9 DVDs\u2014three per Box. The versions were the original broadcast and theatrical versions respectively and therefore different from the previous DVD release. In addition, the video game \"Girlfriend of Steel\" was included in the third box set.\nThe Japanese-only, nine-volume \"Renewal of Evangelion\" DVDs were released on June 25, 2003, with improved acoustic effects, remixed dialogue and remastered soundtrack for 5.1 stereo sound. The first eight volumes covered the original 26 episodes, including two versions of episodes 21 to 24: the (extended) video version (that was available in previous releases) and a reconstruction of the shorter broadcast version, which was made available for the first time since the Genesis 0:X laserdisc and also wasn't censored like in the original broadcast. The ninth volume contained \"Death(true)\u00b2\", while the tenth included \"End of Evangelion\" (omitting \"Rebirth\"). The \"Renewal Project\" release formed the basis for the western \"Platinum Edition\". On December 1, 2014, Studio Khara announced a Blu-ray boxset that will contain a new HD-remastering of the television series, the video versions of Episodes 21\u201324, as well as the two movies, both as \"Revival of Evangelion\", the director's cut, which was available in the \"Renewal\" DVDs, and as their original theatrical versions \"Death and Rebirth\" and \"The End of Evangelion\". In addition, another DVD set, titled \"Archives of Evangelion\", was announced that contains the original unaltered broadcast version of the television series as well as the broadcast version of \"Death (True) &amp; Rebirth\" that aired on January 2, 1998. Both sets were released on August 26, 2015, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the TV series.\nADV Films.\nThe series was distributed in North America and Europe by ADV Films. The 13 English VHS tapes, released from August 20, 1996, to July 7, 1998, contained two episodes each and were released using the same \"Genesis 0:(volume number)\" titling convention as the first Japanese home video release. Two laserdisc collections were released as \"Collection 1 Deluxe Edition\" and \"Collection 2 Deluxe Edition\", containing episodes one to four and five to eight, respectively. The first DVD release by ADV Films was the eight disk \"Perfect Collection\" in 2002, containing the original 26 installments. In 2004, ADV released two DVD compilations titled \"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Resurrection\" and \"Neon Genesis: Reborn\", encompassing the directors' cuts of Episodes 21 through 24. In the same year, the \"Platinum Edition\" release was announced by ADV in 2004, consisting of seven DVDs released between July 27, 2004, and April 19, 2005. The \"Platinum Edition\" contained the original 26 episodes and the four \"Director's cut\" versions of episodes 21 to 24. A six-disc version of the Platinum Edition, the \"Platinum Complete Edition\", was released on November 22, 2005, and omitted several extras included in other versions, including commentary and trailers. A seven-disc \"Platinum Perfect Collection\" tin case version was released on November 27, 2007, and included the extras that were omitted from the \"Platinum Complete Edition\". On November 18, 2008, a seven-disc \"Holiday Edition\" DVD was released; this would be the final DVD release of the series from ADV Films. In late November 2011, it was announced the series was going out of print.\nMadman Anime.\nMadman has held the rights to the series since 1998 in New Zealand and Australia, where \"Evangelion\" was broadcast in 1999 by the Special Broadcasting Service. Madman Anime also holds the home video licences for the \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" films.\nNetflix.\nOn November 26, 2018, streaming company Netflix announced that it had acquired the worldwide streaming rights to the original anime series, as well as \"Evangelion: Death (True)\u00b2\" and \"The End of Evangelion\", for release in Q2 2019. On March 22, 2019, Netflix announced a June 21, 2019 premiere date for the titles. Following the dissolution of ADV Films in late 2009, the Netflix release includes a re-translated script from Studio Khara's in-house translator Dan Kanemitsu and a new English-language cast chosen by Khara. The Netflix release omits \"Fly Me to the Moon\" in some regions due to licensing issues.\nAnime Limited and GKIDS.\nOn May 30, 2020, British anime distributor Anime Limited announced it had acquired home video distribution rights for the original series, \"Evangelion: Death (True)\u00b2\" and \"The End of Evangelion\" in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with an \"Ultimate Edition Blu-ray\" release scheduled for 2021, marking the international release of the original series on Blu-ray. On October 3, 2020, North American anime distributor GKIDS announced it had licensed the original TV series, \"Death (True)\u00b2\" and \"The End of Evangelion\" for home video, theatrical, and digital download release with an Ultimate Edition to be released in 2021, making this the first Blu-ray release of the franchise in North America. On August 30, 2021, GKIDS announced a Collector's Edition and a Standard edition release in addition to the Ultimate Edition. The Collector's/Ultimate edition had the \"Classic Dub and Subtitled Version\" (including the ADV and Manga English dubs and subs), while the standard edition was only included the Netflix English dub and sub. \"Fly Me to the Moon\" was not included in any of the GKIDS/All the Anime releases. The Standard edition was released on November 9, 2021, while the Collector's/Ultimate edition was released on December 8, 2021. On November 2, 2021, GKIDS released the TV series, \"Death (True)\u00b2\" and \"The End of Evangelion\" on all major digital download services six days ahead of the Standard Blu-ray release. This release, like the Standard BD, only contains the Netflix dub and sub.\nReception.\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" received critical acclaim both domestically and internationally during its initial broadcast and in the decades since its release. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 100% based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", both a cultural touchstone for Japan and an uncompromising auteurist vision by creator Hideaki Anno, doubles as an enthralling apex for the mecha anime genre and as a harrowing exploration of depression \u2013 making for a wholly singular epic about angels and inner demons.\"\nThe \"richness\" of the characters and \"complex and layered\" narrative has received praise by critics. In 1998, Max Autohead of \"Hyper\" rated it 10 out of 10, praising the \"brilliant and fantastic storyline, with amazing characters who pull you not only into their world, but into their psyche as well. The same year, Shidoshi of \"GameFan\" magazine gave it an A rating, calling it an \"awesome\" series. Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" described it in 2009 as \"a superior anime, a giant-robot tale of unusual depth, feeling and detail.\"\nFollowing the conclusion of the series' original television broadcast, the public and critical reception to \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" was polarized, particularly with regard to the final two episodes. The experimental style of the finale confused or alienated many fans and spawned debate and controversy; the criticism was largely directed toward the lack of storyline resolution in the final two episodes. Opinion on the finale was mixed, with the audience broadly divided between those who considered the episodes \"deep\", and those who felt their meaning was \"more apparent than real\". The English voice actors admitted that they also had trouble understanding the series' conclusion. The \"Mainichi Times\" wrote that after episode 25, \"nearly all viewers felt betrayed\u00a0... When commentator Eiji \u014ctsuka sent a letter to the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\", complaining about the end of the \"Evangelion\" series, the debate went nationwide.\" Despite the criticism, Anno stood by his artistic choices for the series' conclusion. Critic Zac Bertschy remarked in 2003 that \"Most of the backlash against \"Evangelion\" existed because people don't like to think\". The initial controversy surrounding the end of \"Evangelion\" has had no lasting negative influence on the popularity of the series.\n\"Evangelion\" has developed into a social phenomenon beyond its primary fan base, generating national discussion in Japan. The series has also been the subject of numerous media reports, debates, and research studies worldwide. The show has received review by critics, academics and sociologists alike, including by Susan J. Napier, William Rout, Mick Broderick, Mari Kotani, Shinji Miyadai, Hiroki Azuma, Yuriko Furuhata, and Marc Steinberg. The series has been described as both a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre. Theron Martin (Anime News Network) described the character design as \"distinctive, designed to be sexy rather than cutesy\", and the mecha designs as \"among the most distinctive ever produced for an anime series, with sleek, lithe appearances that look monstrous, fearsome, and nimble rather than boxy and knight-like\". Mike Crandol stated \"It no longer seems contrite to say that \"Evangelion\" is surely one of the all-time great works of animation\". Japanese critic Manabu Tsuribe considered that \"Evangelion\" was \"extremely interior and is lacking in sociality, so that it seems to reflect pathology of the times.\" In February 2004 \"Cinefantastique\" listed the anime as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".\nAwards.\n\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" has scored highly in popularity polls. In 1996, the series won first place in the \"Best Loved Series\" category of the Anime Grand Prix, a reader-polled award series published in \"Animage\" magazine. The show was again awarded this prize in 1997 by a large margin. The \"End of Evangelion\" won first place in 1998, making \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" the first anime franchise to win three consecutive first place awards. The website IGN ranked \"Evangelion\" as the 10th best animated series in its \"Top 100 Animated TV Series\" list. The series also placed third in \"Animage\"s \"anime that should be remembered in the 21st Century\". In 1998, EX.org's readers voted \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" the #1 US anime release and in 1999, the #2 show of all time. In 2007, a large-scale poll by TV Asahi found \"Evangelion\" was the second most appreciated anime in Japan. The series was ranked as the most popular of all time in a 2006 survey of 80,000 attendees at the Japan Media Arts Festival.\n\"Evangelion\" won the Animation Kobe award in 1996, and 1997. The series was awarded the 18th Nihon SF Taisho Award and the Excellence Award at the 1st Japan Media Arts Festival in 1997, while the film ranked #6 on \"Wizard's Anime\" Magazine on their \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\". In the August 1996 issue of \"Animage\", \"Evangelion\" characters placed high in the rankings of best characters with Rei ranked first, Asuka third, Kaworu fourth and Shinji sixth. Rei Ayanami won in the Female Character category in 1995 and 1996 and Shinji Ikari won the Male Character category in 1996 and 1997. In 2010, \"Newtype\" magazine recognized Rei Ayanami as the most popular character of the 1990s in the female category, and Shinji Ikari in the male category. \"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\" won the Animage award in the Best Song category in 1996, and TV Asahi recognized it as the 18th best anime song since 1990. \"TV Asahi\" also recognized the \"suicide of Ayanami Rei\" as the ninth most touching anime scene ever.\nInfluence and legacy.\n\"Evangelion\" has had a significant impact on Japanese popular culture. The series also had a strong influence on anime, at a time when the anime industry and televised anime series were in a slump period. CNET reviewer Tim Hornyak credits the series with revitalizing and transforming the giant mecha genre. In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese animation saw decreased production following the economic crash in Japan. This was followed by a crisis of ideas in the years to come. Against this background, \"Evangelion\" imposed new standards for the animated serial, ushering in the era of the \"new Japanese animation serial\", characterized by innovations that allowed a technical and artistic revival of the industry. The production of anime serials began to reflect greater author control, the concentration of resources in fewer but higher quality episodes (typically ranging from 13 to 26), a directorial approach similar to live film, and greater freedom from the constraints of merchandising. According to Keisuke Iwata, the global spread of Japanese animation dramatically expanded due to the popularity of \"Evangelion\". In Japan, \"Evangelion\" prompted a review of the cultural value of anime, and its success, according to Roland Kelts, made the medium more accessible to the international youth scene. With the interest in the series, otaku culture became a mass social phenomenon. The show's regular reruns increased the number of otaku, while John Lynden links its popularity to a boom in interest in literature on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Kabbalah and Christianity.\nCritics traced \"Evangelion\"'s influence on subsequent anime series, including \"Serial Experiments Lain\", \"RahXephon\", \"Texhnolyze\", \"Gasaraki\", \n\"Guilty Crown\", \"Boogiepop Phantom\", \"Blue Submarine No. 6\", \"Mobile Battleship Nadesico\", ', \"Gurren Lagann\", \"Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure\", \"Argento Soma\", \"Pilot Candidate\", \"Generator Gawl\", and \"Dai-Guard\". References, homages and tributes to the series are also contained in Japanese and Western media such as the third episode of \"Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi\", \"Koi Koi Seven\", \"Hayate the Combat Butler\", \"Baka and Test\", \"Regular Show\", ', \"Gravity Falls\", \"Sgt. Frog\", \"Rick and Morty\", \"One Hour Photo\", \"Steven Universe\", ', and \"Nope\". The show's mixture of religion and mecha also influenced subsequent Japanese video games, including \"Xenogears\" and '.\nThe design and personality traits of the character Rei Ayanami were reused for many anime and manga characters of the late 1990s, such as Ruri Hoshino of \"Nadesico\", Ruriko Tsukushima (\"The Droplet\"), Miharu (\"Gasaraki\"), Anthy Himemiya (\"Revolutionary Girl Utena\"), and Lain Iwakura (\"Serial Experiments Lain\"). The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel (\"Excel Saga\"), and some of her traits were used to create the character of Mai in \"Gunparade March\". According to Italian critic Guido Tavassi, \"Evangelion\"'s mecha design, characterized by a greater resemblance to the human figure, and the abstract designs of the Angels, also had a significant impact on the designs of future anime productions. Nobuhiro Watsuki designed several characters for \"Rurouni Kenshin\" based on characters from \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", namely Uonuma Usui, Honj\u014d Kamatari and Fuji. Other artists have cited the series as an inspiration, including Makoto Shinkai and Gege Akutami for their manga \"Jujutsu Kaisen\". In the aftermath of \"Evangelion\", Anno reused stylistic conceits from the series in the live-action \"Love &amp; Pop\" and the anime romance \"Kare Kano\". \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" also influenced music artists, such as the UK band Fightstar and its debut album, \"Grand Unification\", and the Japanese band Rey, which derived its name from the character of Rei Ayanami.\nMerchandising.\nThe popularity of \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" extends to its merchandising, which exceeded $400\u00a0million within two years of its release. The series has established itself greatly on the Japanese market, developing a varied range of products for adult consumers, such as cell phones (including a special Nerv and Magi-themed Sharp SH-06D smartphone released in 2012), laptop computers, many soundtracks, DVDs, action figures, telephone cards and an official set of Japanese coins. The stylized mecha design that would later earn praise for \"Evangelion\" was initially criticized by certain toy companies as being too difficult to manufacture, with some expressing concern that models of the Evangelion \"mecha\" \"would never sell.\" Eventually, Sega agreed to license all toy and video game sales. At the time of the release of the Japanese film \"Death &amp; Rebirth\" and \"The End of Evangelion\", estimated sales of \"Evangelion\" merchandise topped $300\u00a0million, of which 70% derived from sales of video and laser discs, soundtrack CDs, single CDs, computer software and the three-volume manga. Multiple merchandising products were released during the \"Renewal Project\", such as CDs, video games, cel-art illustrations and collectible models.\nThe commercial exploitation of the series for the home video market achieved record sales and remained strong over a decade later. The fame of the show has grown through home video sales, which exceeded two or three times the sales of other contemporary anime series and films. According to anime critic Guido Tavassi, the series contributed significantly to the spread of the DVD format in Japan and generated a considerable impact on the Japanese economy, calculated in billions of yen. In 2006, Matt Greenfield stated that the franchise had earned over . A 2007 estimate placed total sales of 6,000 related goods at over . By 2015, more than 2million \"Evangelion\" pachinko and pachislot machines had been sold, generating in revenue."}

{"id": "21713", "revid": "1126918295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21713", "title": "Nijmegen", "text": "Nijmegen (; Nijmeegs: \"Nimw\u00e8\u00e8ge\" ) is the largest city in the Dutch province of Gelderland and tenth largest of the Netherlands as a whole, located on the Waal river close to the German border. It is about 60 km south east of Utrecht and 50 km north east of Eindhoven. Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands, the second to be recognized as such in Roman times, and in 2005 celebrated 2,000 years of existence. \nNijmegen became a free imperial city in 1230 and in 1402 a Hanseatic city. Since 1923 it has been a university city with the opening of a Catholic institution now known as the Radboud University Nijmegen. The city is well known for the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen event.\nIts population in 2022 was 179,000; the municipality is part of the Arnhem\u2013Nijmegen metropolitan area, with 736,107 inhabitants in 2011.\nPopulation centres.\nThe municipality is formed by the city of Nijmegen, incorporating the former villages of Hatert, Hees and Neerbosch, as well as the urban expansion project of Waalsprong, situated north of the river Waal and including the village of Lent and the hamlet of 't Zand, as well as the new suburbs of Nijmegen-Oosterhout and Nijmegen\u2013Ressen.\nProximity of border with Germany.\nThe city lies a few kilometers from the border with Germany, and to some extent the westernmost villages in the municipality of Kranenburg, Germany, function as dormitories for people who work in the Dutch city of Nijmegen in part due to the immigration of Dutch people from the region who were attracted by the lower house pricing just across the border.\nThe German city of Duisburg (in the Ruhr region) is about away, while the German town of Kleve (in the Lower Rhine region) is about away.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nThe first mention of Nijmegen in history is in the first century BCE, when the Romans built a military camp on the place where Nijmegen was to appear; the location had great strategic value because of the surrounding hills, which give a good view over the river Waal and Rhine valley.\nBy 69, when the Batavi, the original inhabitants of the Rhine and Meuse (\"Maas\") delta, revolted, a village called \"Oppidum Batavorum\" had formed near the Roman camp. This village was destroyed in the revolt, but when it had ended the Romans built another, bigger camp where the Legio X \"Gemina\" was stationed. Soon after, another village formed around this camp.\nIn 98, Nijmegen was the first of two settlements in what is now the Kingdom of the Netherlands to receive Roman city rights.\nIn 103, the X \"Gemina\" was restationed in Vindobona, now Vienna, which may have been a major blow to the economy of the village around the camp, losing around 5000 inhabitants. In 104 Emperor Trajan renamed the town, which became known as \"Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum\", Noviomagus for short, the ultimate origin of the current name.\nA collection of artifacts from Roman antiquity were compiled by Johannes Smetius in the 17th century, called the Smetius Collection.\nIn January 2022, archaeologists led by Pepijn van de Geer announced the discovery of an intact 2,000-year-old blue glass bowl with a vertical stripe pattern in Nijmegen. Researchers assume that this well-preserved bowl was made in a glass workshop. According to van de Geer, this type of bowl was made by allowing molten glass to cool and harden over a mold.\nMiddle Ages.\nBeginning in the latter half of the 4th century, Roman power decreased and Noviomagus eventually became part of Francia. It also appeared around this time on the Tabula Peutingeriana. In the 8th century Emperor Charlemagne maintained his \"palatium\" in Nijmegen in 777, and possibly on at least three more occasions. During his brief deposition of 830, the emperor Louis the Pious was sent to Nijmegen by his son, Lothair I. Thanks to the Waal, trade flourished.\nThe powerful Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, was born at Nijmegen in 1165. In 1230 his son Frederick II granted Nijmegen city rights. In 1247, the city was ceded to the count of Guelders as collateral for a loan. The loan was never repaid, and Nijmegen has been a part of Gelderland ever since. This did not hamper trade; Nijmegen even became part of the Hanseatic League in 1364.\nThe arts also flourished in this period. Famous medieval painters like the Limbourg brothers were born and educated in Nijmegen. Some of Hieronymus Bosch's ancestors also came from the city.\nEarly modern period.\nDuring the Dutch Revolt, trade came to a halt and even though Nijmegen became a part of the Republic of United Provinces after its capture from the Spanish in 1591, it remained a border town and had to endure multiple sieges. \nIn 1678 Nijmegen was host to the negotiations between the European powers that aimed to put an end to the constant warfare that had ravaged the continent for years. The result was the Treaty of Nijmegen that, unfortunately, failed to provide for a lasting peace.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the fortifications around the city became a major problem. There were too many inhabitants inside the walls, but the fortifications could not be demolished because Nijmegen was deemed as being of vital importance to the defence of the Netherlands. When events in the Franco-Prussian war proved that old-fashioned fortifications were no longer of use, this policy was changed and the fortifications were dismantled in 1874. The old castle had already been demolished in 1797, so that its bricks could be sold.\nWorld War II and Modernity.\nThrough the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, Nijmegen grew steadily. The Waal was bridged in 1878 by a rail bridge and in 1936 by a car bridge, which was claimed to be Europe's biggest bridge at the time. In 1923 the current Radboud University Nijmegen was founded and in 1927 a channel was dug between the Waal and Meuse (\"Maas\") rivers.\nIn 1940, the Netherlands was invaded by Germany, with Nijmegen being the first Dutch city to fall into German hands. On 22 February 1944, Nijmegen was heavily bombed by American planes, causing great damage to the city centre. It was subsequently claimed by the Allies that the American pilots thought they were bombing the German city of Kleve, while the Germans alleged that it was a planned operation authorised by the Dutch government in exile. The Dutch organization for investigating wartime atrocities, the NIOD, announced in January 2005 that its study of the incident confirmed that it was an accident caused by poor communications and chaos in the airspace. Over 750 people died in the bombardment.\nDuring September 1944, the city saw heavy fighting during Operation Market Garden. The objective of the Battle of Nijmegen was mainly to prevent the Germans from destroying the bridges. Capturing the road bridge allowed the British Army XXX Corps to attempt to reach the 1st British Airborne Division in Arnhem. The bridge was heavily defended by over 300 German troops on both the north and south sides with close to 20 anti-tank guns and two anti-aircraft guns, supported with artillery. The Germans' late attempt to blow the road bridge was possibly foiled by a local Dutch resistance hero, Jan van Hoof, who is said to have cut the wires to the bridge. The Germans made repeated attacks on the bridge using bombs attached to driftwood, midget submarines and later resorted to shelling the bridge with 88mm barrages. Troops were positioned on the bridge giving an excellent arc of fire in case of attack. Troops that couldn't fit onto the bridge were positioned in a bombed-out house slightly upstream of the bridge. During the shelling, the house was hit, killing six soldiers and wounding one. Nijmegen was liberated from German occupation by the British Grenadier Guards of the Guards Armoured Division, as well as elements of the American 82nd Airborne Division in September 1944. The city would later be used as a springboard for Operation Veritable, the invasion across the Rhine River by Allied Troops.\nPost-war period.\nIn the period immediately following the end of the war, a site near Nijmegen was selected to house German nationals who were to be deported from the Netherlands, called the Mari\u00ebnbosch concentration camp. It operated from 1946 to 1948.\nOn 23 February 1981, the Nijmegen police department and the Dutch Army stormed the Piersonstraat and Zeigelhof, a squatted housing block in the city centre of Nijmegen. Using 200 riot vans, three Leopard 1s, three armoured personnel carriers, a helicopter, 1,200 policemen, and 750 members of the armed forces, they evicted the squatters and demolished the block, while clouding the entire area in teargas and CS gas. This received enormous backlash in local politics. While the city government wanted the squatters out to build a parking garage, most of the population wanted affordable housing to be built in the area.\nThe city council was largely dominated by left-wing and progressive parties such as Green Party, Democrats 66, Socialist Party, and Labour. At times Nijmegen has been the only major city in the Netherlands with a solely left-wing government. The current mayor is Hubert Bruls.\nNijmegen celebrated its 2000th year of existence in 2005. It is considered the oldest city in the Netherlands. In gaining this qualification, it has competed with the city of Maastricht.\nIn November 2005, the city centre of Nijmegen was the site of the assassination of political activist Louis S\u00e9v\u00e8ke by a former activist, Marcel Teunissen, who was arrested in 2007 in Spain and extradited to the Netherlands. Teunissen has also been accused of bank robbery. He committed his acts out of revenge for a forcible eviction from the squatter scene by Louis S\u00e9v\u00e8ke.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nNijmegen has an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\"). It is one of the warmest cities of the Netherlands, especially during summer, when the highest temperatures in the country are usually measured in the triangle Roermond\u2013Nijmegen\u2013Eindhoven. The lack of north\u2013south oriented mountain ranges in Europe make this area prone to sudden shifts in weather, giving the region a semi-continental climate.\nSome of the northernmost wineries in the world are found just outside Nijmegen, around Groesbeek, a suburban village south-east of Nijmegen.\nDuring the 2006 European heat wave, closest official weather station Volkel reached a high of on 19 July. The heat wave coincided with that year's Four Day Marches, which were cancelled after the first day, when two people died of hyperthermia-related causes. Temperatures on that day, 18 July, reached around in the city.\nSights.\nHistorical remains.\nFew Roman remains are visible today; a fragment of the old city wall can be seen near the casino and the foundations of the amphitheatre are traced in the paving of the present-day Rembrandtstraat. The Valkhof Museum, on the Valkhof, has a permanent display of the history of Nijmegen, including artifacts from the Roman era. Additionally, they usually have temporary exhibitions of more and less famous artists. During building works in the Waapsrong area, ruins from the Roman times were found which were identified in 2022 as those of a Roman sauna. This 3,600 year-old sauna is the first of its kind in mainland Europe. \nNot many very old buildings are left in town: first the Americans carpet-bombed it in February 1944, later the Germans shelled it for about five months after the liberation in September 1944, and finally there were a number of vigorous city planners in the 1950s, 60s and 70s who finished the demolition. There are still a few noteworthy sights, however. Valkhof hill downtown features a Carolingian chapel (eighth, ninth century AD) and a small remainder of an imperial castle that was demolished in 1798. The 750-year old Stevenskerk had to be reconstructed after WWII.\nPolitics.\nThe city council has 39 seats. After the 2002 municipal elections, the three major parties, GroenLinks (9 seats), PvdA (8 seats) and SP (6 seats) formed a coalition. Because these are all left-wing parties, Nijmegen received the nickname 'Havana on the Waal'. Although such majorities are not exceptional (compare Amsterdam) and sometimes also form coalitions (see Muntendam), this is unusual for a city this size. Since such a left-wing coalition might be possible at a national level after the 2006 general election, the achievements of this council are often scrutinised. After the 2006 municipal election such a coalition became possible in many more municipalities, making the example even more interesting.\nThe municipal elections of 7 March 2006 saw an increase of 4,6% of the votes for these three parties taken together, which could be seen as increased support for the coalition. However, nationally these parties scored much better, recovering from an electoral blow of the 2002 elections. Then again, the Leefbaar parties that caused the loss then and lost most of their votes this time have no branch in Nijmegen, which makes this comparison less valid. Among the three big parties, there was a shift from GroenLinks, who lost 6.5%, to PvdA, who won 6.4% and SP, who won 2.3%. As a result, it is no longer the biggest party. The seat assignment is now as shown in the table. The three-party coalition was returned to office.\nAfter the 2010 Dutch municipal election, the PvdA lost three of its eleven seats. Short before the elections, there were problems with the SP. Therefore, GroenLinks and the PvdA formed a coalition with the social-liberal D66.\nThe municipal elections of 19 March 2014 saw the Socialist Party narrowly becoming the largest party in the Nijmegen city council after gaining three more seats. The Greens were only some 200 votes behind, while the Liberal Democrats (D'66) gained another seat, while Labour lost half their support, becoming as small as the liberal-conservative VVD. The coalition government was formed between the three centre-left and leftist parties SP, GroenLinks and PvdA, and a local party called The Nijmegen Group (De Nijmeegse Fractie). It also had informal support from the United Senior Party (VSP).\nLater in 2014, a city council member of the VVD, Paul Eigenhuijsen, left the VVD group. The former leader of the group, Hayke Veldman, had gone to the House of Representatives, and thus left the city council. Eigenhuijsen had been second on the party list, but he was not elected to the position of leader. Thereafter, he left the group and started his own one-man group, called Liberal Nijmegen.\nTwin and sister cities.\nNijmegen is twinned with:\nCulture.\nEvents.\nFour Days Marches.\nNijmegen has long been known for its annual Four Days Marches, beginning on the third Tuesday of each July. Over 40,000 participants from about 70 countries undertake four days of walking with distances ranging from . The marches are supplemented with festivities such as \"de-Affaire\".\nReligion.\nIn 1968, theologians in the Catholic Church issued what is now known as the Nijmegen Statement, demanding sweeping reforms in the Vatican's Holy Office, previously known as The Inquisition, and calling for greater scope for theological inquiry. Among its signatories was theologian Fr. Joseph Ratzinger, then a member of the faculty at the University of T\u00fcbingen, but later the head of the successor to the Holy Office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and later still Pope Benedict XVI.\nThe Nijmegen Statement said: \"Any form of Inquisition however subtle, not only harms the development of sound theology, it also causes irreparable damage to the credibility of the church\". The signatories, a group of predominantly German-speaking theologians asserted that \"the freedom of theologians, and theology in the service of the church, regained by Vatican II, must not be jeopardised again.\" The signatories pledged their loyalty to the Pope, but argued that the teaching office of pope and bishops \"cannot and must not supersede, hamper and impede the teaching task of theologians as scholars.\"\nSport.\nSport in the city is principally focused on its football club NEC Nijmegen or just NEC, short for Nijmegen Eendracht Combinatie, which plays at the 12,500 seat Stadion de Goffert. The club plays in the Eredivisie.\nBandy Vereniging Nijmegen is the biggest bandy club in the country. The national team got celebrated by over a hundred fans and Mayor Hubert Bruls after winning Division B of the 2018 Bandy World Championship.\nThe city is also home to one of the country's oldest cricket clubs, Quick 1888, a current member of the KNCB. Formed in 1888, the club is the largest cricket club in the east of the country and was formed 13 years after the first club, Utile Dulci from Deventer. The cricket club has both men's and women's teams. The city also has the Nijmegen Devils, an Ice hockey club. Nijmegen also plays host to the annual Zevenheuvelenloop (\"Seven Hills Run\"), an annual run recognised by the IAAF as a Bronze Label race.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nEconomy.\nThe three main employers in Nijmegen are:\n1. Radboud University;\n2. The three hospitals in the city: Radboud University Medical Center, , and (CWZ);\n3. The semiconductor industry. Nexperia and Ampleon (both spun off from NXP Semiconductors) are headquartered in the city. Multinational companies such as Qualcomm, Photronics Inc, and Applied Materials also have facilities in Nijmegen.\nOther notable companies headquartered in Nijmegen include Synthon, a Dutch multinational pharmaceutical company and Vaxxinova, an subsidiary which produces animal vaccines.\nMore room for the river Waal.\nTo prevent flooding in the near future, the Dutch government is changing the course of more than 30 rivers throughout the country. These measures, taken along the rivers IJssel, Lek, Maas and Waal, are known as \u2018Room for the River\u2019. Room for the river Waal as it passes Nijmegen is one of these measures. As part of this, the artificial island Veur-Lent was created in 2015.\nThe river Waal not only has a sharp bend near Nijmegen, it also forms a bottleneck. In 1993 and 1995 this led to high water and floods. To prevent this from happening again and to protect inhabitants of the city and its surroundings against the water, work has been done to relocate the Waal dike in Lent and to excavate a large ancillary channel in the flood plains, creating an island in the Waal. The large-scale project involves the construction of three bridges, new dikes and concrete water barriers. On the island, a project of alleged sustainable urbanism is giving birth to an urban river park with possibilities for recreation, culture, water and nature.\nTransport.\nNijmegen has five railway stations: Nijmegen, Nijmegen Dukenburg, Nijmegen Heyendaal, Nijmegen Lent and Nijmegen Goffert. The central station is connected to the national Intercity network. The bus company Breng (a subsidiary of Hermes) operates the city buses in the Arnhem-Nijmegen metropolitan area.\nLike most Dutch cities, bicycles are an important mode of transport. The city is connected to Arnhem, to the north, by a \"fietssnelweg\" (fast cycle highway) which crosses the Snelbinder bridge in the city. During 2010\u20132012 the cycle highway received upgrades to further encourage the use of bicycles for transport between Nijmegen and Arnhem. In May 2016, the Dutch Fietsersbond (Cyclists' Union) awarded the 2016 Fietsstad (Cycling City) award to the city of Nijmegen.\nThe river is a busy freight transport route, with barges to the city as well as passing through on the way between the industrial regions of Germany and the docks at Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Hook of Holland. The Maas\u2013Waal Canal also carries freight through the city.\nEducation.\nNijmegen is host to Radboud University Nijmegen. Founded in 1923 as the first Catholic university in the Netherlands, it used to be called \"Catholic University of Nijmegen\" until 2004, when it took its current name. , it had 22,142 students and 4,921 staff in fte. Radboud University runs the High Field Magnetic Laboratory which is able to achieve some of the highest fields available in Europe at 38 teslas (continuous). The facility is available to outside users, primarily for research purposes.\nThe education and social work departments of the HAN University of Applied Sciences, school for higher-level vocational training are also located in Nijmegen, as are that school's medical departments.\nIn addition to these institutions, there is also an intermediate-level vocational school and a number of secondary schools: Groenschool Nijmegen, Kandinsky College, Nijmeegse Scholengemeenschap Groenewoud (NSG), Citadel College, Stedelijke Scholengemeenschap Nijmegen (SSGN), Canisius College, St. Jorisschool, Mondial College, the Stedelijk Gymnasium (formally the \"Latijnse school\", founded in the 16th century), the Karel de Grote College, Montessori College and the Dominicus College. Of note is also Leefwerkschool Eigenwijs, which caters to students from all over the Netherlands who have been repeatedly expelled from \"regular\" high schools. Leefwerkschool Eigenwijs has its roots in the local activist movement of the early 1980s and is the only school of its kind recognised in the Netherlands.\nNijmegen is also an important centre of Psycholinguistics, home to the Max Planck Institute of Psycholinguistics and the F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging.\nThe Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov while at Radboud University \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.\"\nReferences.\nLiterature"}

There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of Mauritania in the west, to Egypt's Suez Canal.\nVarying sources limit it to the countries of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia, a region that was known by the French during colonial times as \"Afrique du Nord\" and is known by Arabs as the Maghreb.\nThe United Nations definition includes Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, and the Western Sahara, the territory disputed between Morocco and the Sahrawi Republic.\nThe African Union definition includes the Western Sahara and Mauritania but not Sudan. When used in the term Middle East and North Africa (MENA), it often refers only to the countries of the Maghreb.\nNorth Africa includes the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla, and plazas de soberan\u00eda and can also be considered to include other Spanish, Portuguese and Italian regions such as Canary Islands, Madeira, Lampedusa and Lampione.\nThe countries of North Africa share a large amount of ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity with the Middle East.\nNorthwest Africa has been inhabited by Berbers since the beginning of recorded history, while the eastern part of North Africa has been home to the Egyptians. \nThe distinction between North Africa, the Sahel and the rest of the continent is as follows: \nThe Sahel or \"African Transition Zone\" has been affected by many formative epochs in North African history ranging from the Ancient Roman colonization, the subsequent Arab expansion, to the Ottoman occupation. As a result, many modern African nation-states that are included in the Sahel evidence cultural similarities and historical overlap with their North African neighbours. In the present day, North Africa is associated with West Asia in the realm of geopolitics to form a Middle East-North Africa region. The Islamic influence in the area is also significant, and North Africa is a major part of the Muslim world.\nGeography.\nNorth Africa has three main geographic features: the Sahara desert in the south, the Atlas Mountains in the west, and the Nile River and delta in the east. The Atlas Mountains extend across much of northern Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. These mountains are part of the fold mountain system that also runs through much of Southern Europe. They recede to the south and east, becoming a steppe landscape before meeting the Sahara desert, which covers more than 75 percent of the region. The tallest peaks are in the High Atlas range in south-central Morocco, which has many snow-capped peaks.\nSouth of the Atlas Mountains is the dry and barren expanse of the Sahara desert, which is the largest sand desert in the world. In places the desert is cut by irregular watercourses called wadis\u2014streams that flow only after rainfalls but are usually dry. The Sahara's major landforms include ergs, large seas of sand that sometimes form into huge dunes; the hammada, a level rocky plateau without soil or sand; and the reg, a level plain of gravel or small stones. The Sahara covers the southern part of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Libya. Only two regions of Libya are outside the desert: Tripolitania in the northwest and Cyrenaica in the northeast. Most of Egypt is also desert, with the exception of the Nile River and the irrigated land along its banks. The Nile Valley forms a narrow fertile thread that runs along the length of the country.\nSheltered valleys in the Atlas Mountains, the Nile Valley and Delta, and the Mediterranean coast are the main sources of fertile farming land. A wide variety of valuable crops including cereals, rice and cotton, and woods such as cedar and cork, are grown. Typical Mediterranean crops, such as olives, figs, dates and citrus fruits, also thrive in these areas. The Nile Valley is particularly fertile and most of the population in Egypt live close to the river. Elsewhere, irrigation is essential to improve crop yields on the desert margins.\nPeople.\nThe inhabitants of North Africa are roughly divided in a manner corresponding to the principal geographic regions of North Africa: the Maghreb, the Nile valley, and the Sahel. The Maghreb or western North Africa on the whole is believed to have been inhabited by Berbers since at least 10,000 B.C., while the eastern part of North Africa or the Nile Valley has mainly been home to the Egyptians and Nubians. Ancient Egyptians record extensive contact in their Western desert with people that appear to have been Berber or proto-Berber. As the Tassili n'Ajjer and other rock art findings in the Sahara have shown, the Sahara also hosted various populations before its rapid desertification in 3500 B.C and even today continues to host small populations of nomadic trans-Saharan peoples. The archaeological evidence from the Holocene period has shown that Nilo-Saharan speaking groups had populated the central and southern Sahara before the influx of Berber and Arabic speakers, around 1500 years ago, who now largely populate the Sahara in the modern era.\nThe migration of the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym destroyed the civilisation of northen african countries like Egypte, MOrocco, Algeria, Tunisia. They were a bunch of bedounies who don't nothing about culture or civilisation.\nThe official languages in the countries making up the Maghreb are Arabic, Tamazight as a second official language in Algeria and Morocco, and Spanish in Ceuta and Melilla. French is also used as an administrative language in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. The most spoken language is a mix of Berber and Arabic, that follows a Berber grammatical and syntactical structure. For the remaining North African countries, the official language is Arabic. The largest ethnic groups in North Africa are Berbers. The region is predominantly Muslim with a Jewish minority in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, and significant Christian minority\u2014the Copts\u2014in Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia.\nThe inhabitants of the Spanish Canary Islands are of mixed Spanish and North African Berber ancestry, and the people of Malta are of primarily Southern Italian/Sicilian, as well as, to a lesser extent, North African and Middle Eastern ancestry and speak a derivative of Arabic. However, these areas are not generally considered part of North Africa, but rather Southern Europe, due to their proximity to mainland Europe and their European-based cultures and religion.\nCulture.\nThe people of the Maghreb and the Sahara regions speak Berber languages and several varieties of Arabic and almost exclusively follow Islam. The Arabic and Berber languages are distantly related, both being members of the Afroasiatic language family. The Tuareg Berber languages are notably more conservative than those of the coastal cities.\nOver the years, Berbers have been influenced by contact with other cultures: Egyptians, Greeks, Punic people, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, Europeans and Africans. \nThe diverse peoples of North Africa are usually categorized along ethno-linguistic lines. Some Berber-speaking North Africans may identify as \"Arab\" depending on the social and political circumstances, although substantial numbers of Berbers (or \"Imazighen\") have retained a distinct cultural identity which in the 20th century has been expressed as a clear ethnic identification with Berber history and language. This, however, may or may not exclude pride in and identification with Berber and/or other parts of their heritage. \nEgyptians over the centuries have shifted their language from Egyptian (in its late form, varieties of Coptic) to modern Egyptian Arabic while retaining a sense of national identity that has historically set them apart from other people in the region. Most Egyptians are Sunni Muslim, although there is a significant minority of Coptic Christians.\nThe Maghreb formerly had a significant Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or Israel when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 500,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both Sephardi Jews (refugees from Spain, France and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous Mizrahi Jews. Today, less than fifteen thousand remain in the region, almost all in Morocco and Tunisia, and are mostly part of a French-speaking urban elite. (See Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries.)\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nDue to the recent African origin of modern humans, the history of Prehistoric North Africa is important to the understanding of pre-hominid and early modern human history in Africa.\nSome researchers have postulated that North Africa rather than East Africa served as the exit point for the modern humans who first trekked out of the continent in the Out of Africa migration. The earliest inhabitants of central North Africa have left behind significant remains: early remnants of hominid occupation in North Africa, for example, were found in Ain el Hanech, near Sa\u00efda (c. 200,000 BCE); in fact, more recent investigations have found signs of Oldowan technology there, and indicate a date of up to 1.8 million BCE.\nRecent finds in Jebel Irhoud in Morocco have been found to contain some of the oldest \"Homo sapiens\" remains; This suggests that, rather than arising only in East Africa around 200,000 years ago, early \"Homo sapiens\" may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to study author Jean-Jacques Hublin, \"The idea is that early \"Homo sapiens\" dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today.\" Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a \"green Sahara\", around 330,000 to 300,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa. \nIn September 2019, scientists reported the computerized determination, based on 260 CT scans, of a virtual skull shape of the last common human ancestor to modern humans/\"H. sapiens\", representative of the earliest modern humans, and suggested that modern humans arose between 260,000 and 350,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and Southern Africa.\nThe cave paintings found at Tassili n'Ajjer, north of Tamanrasset, Algeria, and at other locations depict vibrant and vivid scenes of everyday life in central North Africa during the Neolithic Subpluvial period (about 8000 to 4000 BCE). Some parts of North Africa began to participate in the Neolithic revolution in the 6th millennium BCE, just before the rapid desertification of the Sahara around 3500 B.C. largely due to a tilt in the Earth's orbit. It was during this period that domesticated plants and animals were introduced in the region, spreading from the north and east to the southwest. There has been an inferred connection between areas of rapid drying and the introduction of livestock in which the natural (orbital) aridification was amplified by the spread of shrubs and open land due to grazing. Nevertheless, changes in northern Africa's ecology after 3500 BCE provided the backdrop for the formation of dynastic civilizations and the construction of monumental architecture such as the Pyramids of Giza.\nArchaeological evidence has attested that population settlements occurred in Nubia as early as the Late Pleistocene era and from the 5th millennium BC onwards, whereas there is \"no or scanty evidence\" of human presence in the Egyptian Nile Valley during these periods, which may be due to problems in site preservation.Several scholars have argued that the African origins of the Egyptian civilisation derived from pastoral communities which emerged in both the Egyptian and Sudanese regions of the Nile Valley in the fifth millennium BCE.\nWhen Egypt entered the Bronze Age, the Maghreb remained focused on small-scale subsistence in small, highly mobile groups. Some Phoenician and Greek colonies were established along the Mediterranean coast during the 7th century BCE.\nAntiquity and ancient Rome.\nThe most notable nations of antiquity in western North Africa are Carthage, Numidia and Mauretania. The Phoenicians colonized much of North Africa including Carthage and parts of present-day Morocco (including Chellah, Essaouira and Volubilis). The Carthaginians were of Phoenician origin, with the Roman myth of their origin being that Dido, a Phoenician princess, was granted land by a local ruler based on how much land she could cover with a piece of cowhide. She ingeniously devised a method to extend the cowhide to a high proportion, thus gaining a large territory. She was also rejected by the Trojan prince Aeneas according to Virgil, thus creating a historical enmity between Carthage and Rome, as Aeneas would eventually lay the foundations for Rome. Ancient Carthage was a commercial power and had a strong navy, but relied on mercenaries for land soldiers. The Carthaginians developed an empire in the Iberian Peninsula, Malta, Sardinia, Corsica and northwest Sicily, the latter being the cause of First Punic War with the Romans.\nOver a hundred years and more, all Carthaginian territory was eventually conquered by the Romans, resulting in the Carthaginian North African territories becoming the Roman province of Africa in 146 B.C. This led to tension and eventually conflict between Numidia and Rome. The Numidian wars are notable for launching the careers of both Gaius Marius, and Sulla, and stretching the constitutional burden of the Roman republic as Marius required a professional army, something previously contrary to Roman values, to overcome the talented military leader Jugurtha. Kingdom of Mauretania remained independent until being annexed to the Roman Empire by Emperor Claudius in 42 AD.\nNorth Africa remained a part of the Roman Empire, which produced many notable citizens such as Augustine of Hippo, until incompetent leadership from Roman commanders in the early fifth century allowed the Germanic peoples, the Vandals, to cross the Strait of Gibraltar, whereupon they overcame the fickle Roman defense. The loss of North Africa is considered a pinnacle point in the fall of the Western Roman Empire as Africa had previously been an important grain province that maintained Roman prosperity despite the barbarian incursions, and the wealth required to create new armies. The issue of regaining North Africa became paramount to the Western Empire, but was frustrated by Vandal victories. The focus of Roman energy had to be on the emerging threat of the Huns. In 468 AD, the Romans made one last serious attempt to invade North Africa but were repelled. This perhaps marks the point of terminal decline for the Western Roman Empire. The last Roman emperor was deposed in 476 by the Heruli general Odoacer. Trade routes between Europe and North Africa remained intact until the coming of Islam. Some Berbers were members of the Early African Church (but evolved their own Donatist doctrine), some were Berber Jews, and some adhered to traditional Berber religion. African pope Victor I served during the reign of Roman emperor Septimius Severus. Furthermore, during the rule of the Romans, Byzantines, Vandals, Ottomans and Carthaginians the Kabyle people were the only or one of the few in North Africa who remained independent. The Kabyle people were incredibly resistible so much so that even during the Arab conquest of North Africa they still had control and possession over their mountains.\nArab conquest to modern times.\nThe early Muslim conquests included North Africa by 640. By 700, most of North Africa had come under Muslim rule. Indigenous Berbers subsequently started to form their own polities in response in places such as Fez and Sijilmasa. In the eleventh century, a reformist movement made up of members that called themselves the Almoravid dynasty expanded south into Sub-Saharan Africa.\nNorth Africa's populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the Banu Sulaym and Banu Hilal. Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.\nAfter the Middle Ages much of the area was loosely under the control of the Ottoman Empire. The Spanish Empire conquered several coastal cities between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the 19th century, the imperial and colonial presence of France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy left the entirety of the region under one form of European occupation.\nIn World War II from 1940 to 1943 the area was the setting for the North African Campaign. During the 1950s and 1960s all of the North African states gained independence. There remains a dispute over Western Sahara between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front.\nThe wider protest movement known as the Arab Spring began with revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt which ultimately led to the overthrow of their governments, as well as civil war in Libya. Large protests also occurred in Algeria and Morocco to a lesser extent. Many hundreds died in the uprisings.\nScience and technology.\n\"Further information in the sections of History of science and technology in Africa:\""}

They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Patriots play home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is southwest of downtown Boston. The franchise is owned by Robert Kraft, who purchased the team in 1994. As of 2022, the Patriots are the ninth most valuable sports team in the world and have sold out every home game since 1994.\nFounded in 1959 as the Boston Patriots, the team was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) before joining the NFL in 1970 through the AFL\u2013NFL merger. The Patriots played their home games at various stadiums throughout Boston until the franchise moved to Foxborough in 1971. As part of the move, the team changed its name to the New England Patriots. Home games were played at Foxboro Stadium until 2002 when the stadium was demolished alongside the opening of Gillette Stadium. The team began utilizing Gillette Stadium for home games the same year.\nThe Patriots hold the records for most Super Bowl wins (6, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers), appearances (11), and losses (5, tied with the Denver Broncos). Generally unsuccessful prior to the 21st century, the franchise enjoyed a period of dominance under head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady from 2001 to 2019. The Brady\u2013Belichick era, regarded as one of the greatest sports dynasties, would see the Patriots claim nearly every major Super Bowl record. Other NFL records held by the franchise include the most playoff wins (37), the most wins in a 10-year period (126 from 2003 to 2012), the longest winning streak of regular season and playoff games (21 from October 2003 to October 2004), the most consecutive winning seasons (19 from 2001 to 2019), the most consecutive conference championship appearances (8 from 2011 to 2018), the most consecutive division titles (11 from 2009 to 2019), the only undefeated 16-game regular season (2007), and the highest postseason winning percentage (.638).\nFranchise history.\nBrief summary.\nOn November 16, 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice \u2013 and the one that Sullivan selected \u2013 was the \"Boston Patriots\", with \"Patriots\" referring to the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation, which heavily involved the then-colony of Massachusetts. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of \"The Boston Globe\" developed the \"Pat Patriot\" logo.\nThe Patriots never had a regular home stadium in the AFL. Nickerson Field, Harvard Stadium, Fenway Park (shared with baseball's Boston Red Sox), and Boston College's Alumni Stadium all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. The 1963 season saw the franchise's first playoff win over Buffalo to clinch the division. They subsequently lost the AFL championship game to the San Diego Chargers 51\u201310. They did not appear again in an AFL or NFL post-season game for another 13 years.\nWhen the NFL and AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots were placed in the American Football Conference (AFC) East division, where they still play today. The following year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which would serve as their home for the next 30 years. As a result of the move, they announced they would change their name from the Boston Patriots to the Bay State Patriots, after the state of Massachusetts. The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they would change its geographic name to New England.\nDuring the 1970s, the Patriots had some success under head coach Chuck Fairbanks, earning a berth to the playoffs in 1976 \u2013 as a wild card team \u2013 and in 1978 \u2013 as AFC East champions. They lost in the first round both times. Under his successor, Ron Erhardt, the team finished one game out of the playoffs his first two years. The next coach, Ron Meyer, led the team to the playoffs in the strike-shortened 1982 season, and despite not having a losing record during his career, he was fired in 1984 due to poor relationships with players and management. Hall-of-Fame player Raymond Berry was hired as his replacement, and in 1985, he brought the team to its first AFC Championship and a berth in Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46\u201310. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. Berry left the team following a disappointing 1989 season, and his replacement Rod Rust only lasted one season, 1990, during which the Patriots went 1\u201315. During the late 1980s and early 1990s they changed ownership several times, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Though Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former New York Giants coach Bill Parcells in 1993. Orthwein and his marketing team then defied Patriots fans' overwhelming preference and commissioned the NFL to develop a new visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms. Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 for $175million to Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft, who had bought the Patriots' then-home, Foxboro Stadium, out of bankruptcy in 1988.\nContinuing on as head coach under Kraft's ownership, Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI (following the 1996 season), which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35\u201321. Pete Carroll, Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 and 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.\nThe Patriots hired head coach Bill Belichick, who had served as defensive coordinator under Parcells including during Super Bowl XXXI, in 2000. Their new home field, Gillette Stadium, opened in 2002 to replace the aging Foxboro Stadium. Long\u2013time starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who was the franchise's star throughout the 1990s, went down with a sheared blood vessel in his chest in a week two match\u2013up in 2001 against the rival New York Jets. Backup quarterback Tom Brady, drafted by the Patriots in sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft, became the starting quarterback. Brady's successful play led to Bledsoe never getting his job back as a starter, and would serve as the franchise's starting quarterback for the next 18 years. Under Belichick and Brady, the Patriots became one of the most consistently dominant teams in the NFL, with many describing the team as a \"dynasty\". Within the first few seasons of the 21st century, the team won three Super Bowls in four seasons (2001, 2003, and 2004), over the St. Louis Rams, Carolina Panthers, and Philadelphia Eagles, respectively. The Patriots finished the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16\u20130 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its regular season schedule to 16 games. After advancing to Super Bowl XLII, the team's fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were upset by the Giants to end their bid for a 19\u20130 season. With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18\u20131, becoming only one of three teams to go 18\u20131 along with the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears. However, both the Bears and 49ers lost their only game during the regular season, and both would win their respective Super Bowl.\nThe Patriots returned to the Super Bowl in 2011 but lost again to the Giants, 21\u201317. In 2014, the Patriots reached a record-tying eighth Super Bowl, where they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28\u201324 to win Super Bowl XLIX for their fourth title. After Seattle had driven the ball to New England's 1-yard line with under a minute to go, New England rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler made a critical interception on Seattle's final offensive play that helped to seal the victory. New England became the first team to reach nine Super Bowls in the 2016\u201317 playoffs and faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. Losing 28\u20133 midway through the third quarter, the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation. In the first overtime in Super Bowl history, the Patriots won the coin toss and scored a touchdown to claim their fifth Super Bowl victory. The Patriots extended their record to ten Super Bowl appearances in the 2017\u201318 playoffs but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. The Patriots returned to the championship game for a third consecutive season in Super Bowl LIII, where they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13\u20133 to win their sixth Super Bowl, tying them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for most Super Bowl victories in NFL history.\nFollowing a disappointing 2019 season, in which the team lost in the first round of the playoffs, and in which the long-time Brady\u2013Belichick partnership was strained due to Brady wanting to have more input in organizational decisions, Brady left for free agency and was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. To replace him, the Patriots signed veteran quarterback Cam Newton, but after an even more disappointing 2020 season, which saw the team miss the playoffs with their first losing record in two decades, the team drafted Mac Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft, and released Newton after naming Jones the starting quarterback just prior to the team's first game of the 2021 season. Jones led the team to their first playoff berth without Brady since 1998, but they would lose 47\u201317 to the division rival Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card round.\nLogos and uniforms.\nLogos.\nThe Patriots original helmet logo was a simple tricorne hat, used only for the 1960 season. From 1961 to 1992, the Patriots used a logo of a Revolutionary War minuteman hiking a football. The Patriots wordmark logo during this time consisted of a western-style font. The minuteman logo became known as the \"Pat Patriot\" logo, which later became the name of the team's mascot.\nIn 1979, the Patriots worked with NFL Properties to design a new, streamlined logo, to replace the complex Pat Patriot logo. The new logo featured the blue and white profile of a minuteman in a tricorne hat set against a flag showing three red stripes separated by two white stripes. Team owner Billy Sullivan decided to put the new logo up to a vote against Pat Patriot with the fans at the September 23 home game against the San Diego Chargers, using a sound level meter to judge the crowd's reaction. The new logo was decidedly rejected by the crowd in favor of Pat, and the concept was shelved.\nIn 1993, a new logo was unveiled involving the gray face of a minuteman wearing a red, white and royal blue hat that begins as a tricorne and transitions into a flowing banner-like design. It became popularly known as the \"Flying Elvis\" due to many observing its resemblance to the profile of a young Elvis Presley. A new script logo was introduced as well in tandem with the \"Flying Elvis\", utilizing a cursive font.\nIn 2000, the blue color used on the tricorne of the \"Flying Elvis\" as well as the outline of the cursive wordmark was switched from royal blue to nautical blue to coincide with the uniform change in the new millennium.\nOn July 3, 2013, the Patriots unveiled a new wordmark to accompany the \"Flying Elvis\", which replaced the script of their previous cursive typeface with modernized block letters (colored in blue or white depending on the background), and modified the \"Flying Elvis\" to be underneath instead of flowing up-top. While appearing everywhere else, it was not applied on the uniforms until the 2015 season due to NFL uniform policies.\nUniforms.\n1960\u20131992.\nThe Patriots' primary uniforms remained largely unchanged from the franchises' inaugural season until 1993. The Patriots originally wore red jerseys with white block numbering at home, and white jerseys with red block numbering on the road. Both uniforms used white pants and white helmets, first with the hat logo over the player's number, then with the \"Pat Patriot\" logo starting in 1961. A blue stripe was added to the two red helmet stripes in 1964. The numbers on both the home and away jerseys gained a blue outline in 1973. In 1979, the Patriots began the first of many sporadic runs of wearing red pants with the white jerseys. The red pants were dropped in 1981, but returned in 1984. After being dropped again in 1988, they were used again from 1990 to 1992.\n1993\u20131999.\nThe Patriots underwent a complete identity overhaul before the 1993 season, starting with the introduction of the aforementioned \"Flying Elvis\" logo. The new uniforms consisted of a royal blue home jersey and a white away jersey. The helmet was silver with the Flying Elvis logo and no additional striping. Both uniforms used silver pants, originally with stripes designed to look like those flowing from the Flying Elvis, but these were changed to simple red and blue stripes after one season. When they debuted, both the home and away jerseys used red block numbers with a blue and white outline, but after one season the home uniforms switched to the now-familiar white with a red outline.\nIn 1995, the Patriots switched the block numbers to a more modern rounded number font with a dropshadow. The Patriots were one of the first adopters of custom numbers, a trend that would grow drastically over the next 20 years.\n2000\u20132019.\nIn 2000, the Patriots then became one of the few teams at the time to drop the rounded numbers and switch back to block numbers. The shade of blue was switched for the first time in the franchises' history, from royal to nautical blue. The jerseys once again had the number on the shoulders while the logo moved back to the sleeves. \"New Century\" silver stripes were also added to the home jersey, with nautical blue stripes appearing on the away jersey. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the 1990s white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.\nThough the Patriots had generally worn silver pants with the blue jerseys, and navy pants with the white jerseys, they did wear an all-blue set during the 2002 season. On two consecutive home games that season, the Patriots wore blue tops with their road blue pants and white socks; they lost both games (Week 6 vs. the Packers, and Week 8 vs. the Broncos). The team would not wear an all-blue set again until the introduction of the Color Rush uniforms in 2016.\nThroughout the 2011 season, the Patriots wore dark patches with white lettering on their uniforms with the initials 'MHK' in honor of Myra Kraft, the late long-time spouse of owner Robert Kraft.\n2020\u2013present.\nFor the 2020 season, the Patriots made some changes to their uniform. The all-blue \"Color Rush\" design became the primary home uniform, complete with updated block letters and numbers, and blue/red/white socks. A corresponding white uniform was also unveiled, also paired with the blue pants. Both uniforms featured truncated shoulder striping as a nod to the \"Pat Patriot\" uniforms. Coincidentally, the arrival of new jerseys occurred with the departure of long-time quarterback, Tom Brady, from the Patriots. Brady was in New England exactly between the last uniform change in 2000, and left before the 2020 uniform change in 2019.\nThe Patriots brought back the silver pants to pair with the current uniforms in a 2022 Week 7 home game on Monday Night Football against the Chicago Bears. Unlike the previous silver pants the team wore from 2000 to 2019, this design featured thicker red stripes, matching the same width as the middle blue stripe.\nAlternate uniforms.\nIn 1994, the Patriots wore the \"Pat Patriot\" helmets and plain white striped pants from two seasons prior as alternates as part of the NFL's 75th-anniversary celebration. In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate, complemented with the old-style \"Pat Patriot\" helmet. In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the \"Flying Elvis\" helmet was used. The uniform was identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after 2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by the \"Pat Patriot\" helmet. An alternate white road jersey was also worn with the older helmet for one game, using red numbers, in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the AFL. The red alternate gained a blue outline around the numbers in 2010 and this was worn through 2012. The Patriots temporarily retired their alternate red uniforms in 2013, thanks to a new NFL rule outlawing throwback alternate helmets, and restricting teams to one helmet shell only. However, after the NFL reinstated the use of alternate helmets in 2022, the Patriots brought back the throwback red uniforms.\nIn 2016, the Patriots took part in the NFL's Color Rush program, wearing monochrome navy uniforms on September 22 against the Houston Texans. The uniform tops were patterned after the 1980s Pat Patriot-era uniforms, while the pants featured thick white stripes with red accents. They have worn them a total of four times since 2016. In 2017, an all-white Color Rush uniform was introduced and used for the Patriots' Thursday night road game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nFacilities.\nStadium and headquarters.\nSince 2002, the Patriots' home stadium has been Gillette Stadium, a $350million facility privately financed by Robert Kraft, located in Foxborough, Massachusetts. It houses the team's practice facilities, the team's administrative offices, as well as its owning entity's, The Kraft Group, along with the Kraft-owned Major League Soccer team, the New England Revolution. The field, which was originally natural grass, was replaced with a FieldTurf surface during the 2006 season. Despite not being around for more than 20 years, Gillette Stadium is home to the second most postseason games ever, Candlestick Park being first with 27 total. The Patriots have a 20\u20134 playoff record in this stadium as of the conclusion of the 2019 NFL season, the AFC playoffs consistently had the Patriots playing from home in 2001\u20132019. The area around the stadium was developed, beginning in 2007, into a $375million \"lifestyle and entertainment center\" called Patriot Place; among its largest structures is a multi-floor restaurant and bar called CBS Scene.\nPrior to 2002, the Patriots played in Foxboro Stadium dating back to 1971, the team's second year in the NFL after the AFL\u2013NFL merger, and this venue was also privately funded. The final game in this stadium was the 2001 AFC Divisional Playoff game which was a 16\u201313 overtime win over the visiting Oakland Raiders, known for the raging snowstorm and the \"tuck rule\" call.\nDuring the team's days in the American Football League and its first year in the NFL, the Boston Patriots were hosted by a number of fields in or around Boston \u2013 they played at Nickerson Field (1960\u201362), Fenway Park (1963\u201368), Alumni Stadium (1969), and Harvard Stadium (1970).\nTraining camp and practice.\nThe Patriots hold training camp and practices just outside of Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, with twin practice fields available for team use.\nPrior to 2003, the Patriots held training camp and practice at numerous locations. From 1976 to 2002, the team held training camp at Bryant College in Smithfield, Rhode Island. From 1960 to 1961, then from 1969 to 1975, the Patriots held training camp at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Between 1962 and 1968, the Patriots held training camp at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.\nFrom 1971 until 2001, the Patriots would simply practice at Foxboro Stadium whenever the field was available, otherwise they would use the public football fields that were available in Foxborough.\nAircraft.\nIn 2017, the Patriots purchased two Boeing 767-300ERs for use as team planes, with one serving as the backup, which were ready in time for the 2017 NFL season. This made them the first team in league history to own their own planes. At the time it was getting more difficult for professional sports teams to book private charter flights, with eight teams being dropped that season, as major commercial airlines were instead focusing on more profitable scheduled flights. The two jet airliners, N366AA and N39367, were previously operated by American Airlines from 1991 to 2016. The planes are known affectionately as \"AirKrafts\" after team owner Robert Kraft. Kraft has lent one of the planes to transport students to the March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. Both planes are currently operating for the American airline, Eastern Airlines, LLC.\nRivalries.\nIn terms of number of games played, the Patriots have competed most against other teams in the AFC East division: the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, and New York Jets, who were all a part of the AFC East division since the AFL-NFL Merger, as well as the former AFL Eastern division. The Patriots also share rivalries with several teams outside of their division, including the Indianapolis Colts, who were members of the AFC East from 1970 to 2001, the Baltimore Ravens, the Denver Broncos, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Las Vegas Raiders. Outside of the AFC, the Patriots also had a memorable rivalry with the New York Giants.\nDivisional rivals.\nNew York Jets.\nThe closest rivalry geographically has been that with the New York Jets. The Patriots and Jets have been in the same division (what is now the AFC East) since both teams' foundings in 1960, and have played each other at least twice a year since then. The rivalry between the Jets and Patriots has escalated since 1996, when Patriots head coach Bill Parcells left the Patriots under controversy to become the head coach of the Jets; he was replaced by former Jets coach Pete Carroll. Four years later, Carroll was fired, and Parcells's assistant, Bill Belichick, resigned the day he was named the Jets' head coach to become the head coach of the Patriots. Six years after that, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, became the head coach of the Jets.\nBill Belichick achieved his 200th career head coaching win (regular season and playoffs) on November 22, 2012, defeating the Jets 49\u201319; it was his 163rd such win as Patriots coach. Belichick also passed George Halas for second most career head coaching wins (regular season and playoffs) with his 325th win on October 30, 2022, in a 22\u201317 victory over the Jets.\nBuffalo Bills.\nThe Patriots and the Bills were both charter members of the AFL, and even competed with each other in an AFL playoff game. They have remained divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O. J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady dominated the Bills during his tenure as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 32\u20133 regular-season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually felt apathetic towards the Bills during the Brady era, Bills fans came to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. With the departure of Tom Brady after the 2019 season, the Bills swept the Pats in 2020, including a 38\u20139 \"Monday Night Football\" win that stands as the worst home loss of the Belichick era. It was their first time doing so since 1999, Belichick's first year as head coach and the year before Brady was drafted.\nIn the 2021\u201322 NFL playoffs, the Bills defeated the Patriots 47\u201317 in the rivalry's first playoff matchup in nearly 60 years, with the Bills scoring seven consecutive touchdowns and never punting or attempting a field goal against the Pats defense, making for the NFL's first \"perfect offensive game\" in history and the worst playoff loss of Belichick's career.\nMiami Dolphins.\nThe Patriots first played the Miami Dolphins in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami was one of two expansion teams to debut that year in that league. The Dolphins dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive with each other for years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against the Dolphins in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s. The Patriots and Dolphins are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami going 14\u20130 in 1972 and the Patriots going 16\u20130 in 2007. Notable moments between the clubs include the Snowplow Game, three playoff matchups, the Dolphins revealing their Wildcat offense against the Patriots, and the Miracle in Miami.\nConference rivals.\nBaltimore/Indianapolis Colts.\nThe Patriots rivalry with the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts ran through the two clubs' tenure together in the AFC East (1970\u20132001). The two clubs clashed in several close games, such as on December 19, 1971, as a late Patriots touchdown decided a 21\u201317 New England win; on September 18, 1978, the Colts rallied to defeat the Patriots 34\u201327 on \"Monday Night Football\" on a virtual one-man scoring rampage by running back Joe Washington; on September 4, 1983, the Colts defeated the Patriots in overtime 29\u201323 in their final season in Baltimore. The Patriots defeated the Colts in back-to-back overtime games, 23\u201317 on December 8, 1991, and 37\u201334 on November 15, 1992.\nEven though the two clubs were placed in separate divisions in the NFL's 2002 divisional realignment, their rivalry did not diminish. At that time, both teams were among the best in the AFC, and both were led by likely Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Peyton Manning (for the Colts) and Tom Brady (for the Patriots). The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's Super Bowl each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning's rookie season, 1998; in 1999 Manning suffered a bitter 31\u201328 loss in September as the Patriots behind Drew Bledsoe erased a 28\u20137 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20\u201315 in Indianapolis on December 12. The Brady\u2013Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44\u201313 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the RCA Dome 38\u201317.\nAfter the Colts left the AFC East in 2002, they first met on November 30, 2003, in a 38\u201334 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots. The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005, then won twice in 2006; in the AFC Championship Game the Colts erased a 21\u20136 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times in the second half before a late touchdown led to a 38\u201334 Colts win. The November 4, 2007, meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8\u20130 Patriots and the 7\u20130 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24\u201320. The Colts won again in 2008 and then erased a large Patriots lead in 2009's 4th and 2 game. Manning's final meeting with the Patriots as a Colt came in November 2010; a late interception sealed a 31\u201328 Patriots win.\nIn 2012, the Patriots faced the Colts, quarterbacked now by Andrew Luck, on November 18; the Patriots defeated the Colts 59\u201324. The Patriots also beat the Colts on January 12, 2014, 43\u201322. The Patriots played the Colts in the playoffs again on January 18, 2015, in the AFC title game, winning 45\u20137.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nThe Ravens first met the New England Patriots in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27\u201324 loss in the Patriots' quest for perfection. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Ravens lost to the Patriots 27\u201321 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game. The Ravens defeated the Patriots in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoff game, 33\u201314. This was the first time the Ravens had ever defeated the Patriots.\nThe Ravens faced the Patriots in week six of the 2010 season. The Patriots ended up winning 23\u201320 in overtime; the game caused controversy from a hit to the helmet of tight end Todd Heap by Patriots safety Brandon Meriweather.\nThe Ravens played the Patriots for the third consecutive season in the 2011 AFC Championship Game, which the Ravens lost 23\u201320. The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20\u201316 lead in the fourth quarter, but Patriots quarterback Tom Brady dove into the end zone to make the score 23\u201320 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown. On the Ravens' last possession of the game, quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass to wide receiver Lee Evans in the corner of the end zone which looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last-second strip by Sterling Moore forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last-minute field goal by Ravens placekicker Billy Cundiff. With 11 seconds remaining on the clock, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to Super Bowl XLVI for a rematch with the New York Giants.\nThe Ravens' first regular-season win over the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was emotional as receiver Torrey Smith was competing following the death of his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before. Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13\u20130 lead in the first half and led 14\u201313, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20\u201314 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30\u201321 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on Devin McCourty put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker Justin Tucker booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as Bill Belichick angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.\nThe two teams met again on January 20, 2013, in the AFC Championship, where the Ravens won 28\u201313. The Patriots led at halftime, 13\u20137, but the Ravens defense gave up no points in the 2nd half. It was the first time ever that Tom Brady lost a game at home after leading at halftime, and the first time a road team beat the Patriots in the AFC Championship.\nThe two teams met once again at Gillette Stadium in the playoffs on January 10, 2015. The Patriots trailed by as much as 14 twice, before beating the Ravens 35\u201331 to advance to the AFC Championship.\nThe two teams met with Lamar Jackson as the Ravens quarterback for the first time on Sunday Night Football on November 3, 2019. The 8\u20130 Patriots were favored over the 5\u20132 Ravens before the game, but the Ravens won in a blowout, 37\u201320.\nDenver Broncos.\nThe Broncos and Patriots met twice annually during the American Football League (AFL) years from 1960 to 1969, and played in the first-ever AFL game on September 9, 1960. Since , the two teams have met frequently during the regular season, including nine consecutive seasons from 1995 to 2003. As of the end of the season, the two teams have met in the playoffs five times, with the Broncos owning a 4\u20131 record. The teams' first playoff match on January 4, 1987 was John Elway's first career playoff win, while the teams' second playoff match on January 14, 2006 game was the Broncos' first playoff win since Elway's retirement after the 1998 season. The game was also notable for Champ Bailey's 100-yard interception that resulted in a touchdown-saving tackle by Benjamin Watson at the 1-yard line. On October 11, 2009, the two teams met with former Patriots' offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels as the Broncos' head coach. Both teams wore their AFL 50th anniversary jerseys. The game featured a 98-yard drive in the fourth quarter, with a game-tying touchdown pass from Kyle Orton to Brandon Marshall, followed by an overtime drive led by Orton that resulted in a 41-yard game-winning field goal by Matt Prater. The two teams met in the Divisional round of the 2011 playoffs, with the Patriots blowing out Tim Tebow and the Broncos by a score of 45\u201310. The Broncos' rivalry with the Patriots later intensified when longtime Indianapolis Colts' quarterback Peyton Manning became the Broncos' starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015. Manning and Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady maintained a legendary rivalry from until Manning's retirement after the season. Though Brady dominated Manning in regular season play, winning nine of twelve meetings, Manning won three of five playoff meetings, including the Broncos' 26\u201316 win in the 2013 AFC Championship and the Broncos' 20\u201318 win in the 2015 AFC Championship.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28\u20133 while the Steelers won 7\u20136 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30\u201314 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15\u20131 regular season.\nThe Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (\u2013) before the Steelers broke through with a 33\u201310 victory at Foxborough in , after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55\u201331. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28\u201321) and 2016's regular season (27\u201316), and then won 36\u201317 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back. Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17\u201310 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.\nIn the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135\u201375, with the Patriots maintaining a 4\u20131 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2\u20131), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2\u20130), and the Broncos (5\u20133). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15\u201313 against the Patriots. In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12\u20134 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33\u20133 on Sunday Night Football.\nOakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders.\nThe rivalry between the Patriots and the Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley was permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety Jack Tatum. Before that, the Patriots also lost a playoff game in 1976 to the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as \"The Ben Dreith Game\" due to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. While based in Los Angeles, the Raiders hosted the Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs in 1986. The game was won by the Patriots and marred by a chaotic rumble between the teams in the end zone as players were leaving the field after the game. The brawl was especially notable for Raiders linebacker Matt Millen attacking GM Patrick Sullivan, son of owner Billy Sullivan, with his helmet. The two teams met in a divisional-round playoff game in 2002, which became known as the \"Tuck Rule Game\". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and the Patriots went on to win in overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored St. Louis Rams. Since that game, the Patriots have won five of the last six regular-season contests between the two teams. The first contest being the following year during the 2002 season in Oakland, with the Raiders winning 27\u201320; they met in the 2005 season opener in New England with the Patriots ruining Randy Moss' debut as a Raider 30\u201320; the Patriots defeated the Raiders 49\u201326 in December 2008 in Bill Belichick's 100th regular-season win as Patriots coach; a Patriots 31\u201319 win during the 2011 season; a scrappy 16\u20139 Patriots win in the third week of the 2014 season, and the Patriots' 33\u20138 win in Mexico City in 2017.\nInter-conference rivals.\nNew York Giants.\nThe two teams rarely played each other given they were on opposite conferences, but the rivalry gained notoriety in the late 2000s thanks to some close contests and memorable moments between Tom Brady and Eli Manning. In the 2007 season, the Patriots defeated the Giants 38\u201335 to clinch a perfect 16\u20130 regular season, but could not finish a perfect 19\u20130 season in Super Bowl XLII following a 17\u201314 defeat. That game featured the now-iconic Helmet Catch from David Tyree. The Giants also defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, a 21\u201317 victory.\nStrategy and influence.\nUnder head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots have employed specific on-field and off-field strategies. On the field, the Patriots have typically used an \"Erhardt\u2013Perkins\" offense and a \"Fairbanks\u2013Bullough\" 3\u20134 defense, referred to commonly as a two-gap 3\u20134 defensive system. Under Erhardt's, Perkin's and Bullough's stints as coordinators and head coaches across the league after developing the scheme in collaboration with head coach Chuck Fairbanks, the systems developed in New England in the 1970s would begin to see historic use. Influence spread, especially under their coaching tree in Bill Parcells' schemes as head coach of the New York Giants in the mid-to-late 1980s, after serving as a linebacker coach for the Patriots in 1980. Parcells would come back to New England as head coach in 1993 and re-install the system used in the 1970s and 1980s, re-uniting with Ray Perkins as WR coach. Parcells own coaching tree would use the scheme created in New England as well, especially Belichick, once he was named as head coach after years of being an assistant to Parcells with the New York Giants, the Patriots, and the New York Jets.\nSince 2000, the philosophy in making personnel decisions and in game planning has focused on the \"team\" concept, stressing preparation, strong work ethic, versatility, and lack of individual ego. This approach, which has led to six Super Bowl victories under Belichick, has been analyzed in media such as the 2004 book \"Patriot Reign\", as well as the 2021 documentary miniseries .\nThe New England Patriots are noted for the following characteristics under coach Belichick's tenure, dubbed as the \"Patriot Way\":\nChampionships.\nSuper Bowl championships.\nThe Patriots have won six Super Bowls, the league championship of the NFL. The franchise is tied for the most all-time with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The team repeated as champions between the 2003 and 2004 NFL seasons, the last club to do so among the seven franchises who have accomplished it (Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers (twice), San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, and the Denver Broncos). Between 2001 and 2004, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the Dallas Cowboys) to win three Super Bowls in four years (2001, 2003, 2004), and are also the last franchise to have achieved it.\nAFC championships.\nThe New England Patriots have won eleven AFC Championships, the record for the most conference championships all-time in the NFL.\nDivision championships.\nThe New England Patriots have won 22 Division Championships, which is second place for the most all-time behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys, who are tied in first with 24. One of these divisional titles was won in the AFL in the AFL East (1963), the rest were won in the AFC East of the NFL.\nStatistics, records, and awards.\nSeason-by-season results.\nThis is a partial list of the Patriots' last five completed seasons.

The Patriots' total number of Pro Football Hall of Famers is 11, 9 players and 2 coaches.\nNotes:\nRetired numbers.\nThe Patriots have officially retired seven uniform numbers. The organization has not retired any numbers since 2000, likely to keep a healthy amount of numbers available to the up-to 90-man pre-season roster. Half of these players played for the original AFL-era Boston Patriots. Bruce Armstrong (1987\u20132000) is by far the most recent player to have their jersey retired. Five of the seven numbers were retired prior to Robert Kraft's current tenure as owner since 1994. As of 2020, number 12 has been kept out of circulation, otherwise the Patriots have currently abstained from reducing any other number un-officially regardless of stature.\nPatriots Hall of Fame.\nThe Patriots Hall of Fame features 28 former players and three contributors as a part of the franchise's own hall of fame, founded to independently honor significant members of the organization within the club's history. It was established in 1991, with John Hannah being the inaugural member.\nThe physical Patriots Hall of Fame building opened in 2008 outside of the stadium at Patriot Place, presented by Raytheon Technologies. It has featured numerous renovations and additions since, and it is updated yearly. It is described as a modern, interactive \"museum\".\nA committee of media and staff selected 11 players for enshrinement between 1991 and 2001, before a six-year span of no selections. In 2007, in advance of the grand opening of the physical Patriots Hall of Fame in 2008, the club introduced a new nomination committee to select three candidates, with the winner of an internet fan vote being enshrined in the hall of fame. In order to be eligible, players and coaches must be retired for at least four years. Beginning in 2011, and meeting every five years, a senior selection committee has the option of voting a player who has been retired for at least 25 seasons into the hall of fame.\nStarting in 2009, contributors have been allowed to be periodically voted into the Patriots Hall of Fame. Former team founder and owner Billy Sullivan was posthumously inducted by owner Robert Kraft in March 2009, before the Patriots' 50th season, as the first contributor inducted.\nNFL All-Decade and Anniversary team selections.\nThe following Patriots were named to the AFL All-Time Team (1960\u20131969), as well any NFL All-Decade Team after the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970 (and NFL 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams, selected in 1994 and 2019, respectively). Only those who spent time with New England during the respective decades are listed for All-Decade team selections.\nBold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nPatriots All-Decade teams.\nStarting in 2010, every ten years the Patriots Hall of Fame committee will release an all-decade team to celebrate the greatest members of the team at every position during each respective decade.

Mike Holovak in 1963 and 1966 (AFL), Chuck Fairbanks in 1978, and Bill Belichick in 2006 and 2010.\nFirst-team All-Pro selections.\nThe following Patriots players have been named AP First-team All-Pro (or All-AFL prior to 1970):\n \nAdministration and personnel.\nOwnership.\nThe Patriots have had four owners since becoming a franchise, the first being Massachusetts native Billy Sullivan from 1959 to 1988. During Sullivan's 28 seasons of owning the club, the Patriots tallied 14 winning records, made six playoff appearances, played in the 1963 AFL Championship Game and represented the AFC in Super Bowl XX. However, he was also notoriously cheap, and would cause friction with some his high-profile players who were seeking to be respected and paid what they were worth, causing some like future Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Haynes to seek an owner who was team first.\nFollowing his bankruptcy, Sullivan sold the team to Remington Products owner Victor Kiam in 1988. The sale did not include Foxboro Stadium, which Sullivan lost in a bankruptcy sale to paper magnate Robert Kraft, and Kiam lost money on the deal. In 1990, Lisa Olson, a \"Boston Herald\" reporter, sued Kiam and the Patriots when Zeke Mowatt allegedly exposed himself and made lewd comments to her in the team change room. The incident stirred debate over female reporters in the locker room. Kiam became the center of the controversy when he came to the defense of the players' actions.\nIn his later career, Kiam's business interests moved on from the Patriots, so he sold them in 1992 to St. Louis businessman James Orthwein. During his ownership, Orthwein hired Bill Parcells as head coach and oversaw the drafting of first-overall draft pick quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who helped to return the moribund franchise to respectability. He planned to relocate the Patriots franchise to St. Louis, renaming the team the St. Louis Stallions. However, those plans were derailed when Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft, owner of Foxboro Stadium, refused to accept a buyout of the lease. Kraft used his ownership of the stadium to stage a hostile takeover, offering to pay $175 million for the Patriots franchise knowing that Orthwein no longer wanted the team if he could not move it to St. Louis. Although future St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke offered to buy the team for $200 million and move it to St. Louis, Orthwein would have been saddled with all moving expenses. He also would have been responsible for any legal expenses as well, and Kraft had already made it clear that he would go to court to enforce the lease. With no other choice, Orthwein accepted Kraft's bid on January 21, 1994.\nKraft had been a life-long fan (he was a season ticket holder since 1971) before he purchased the team and intended to support them much more than all of the previous owners did, making multiple moves that have turned New England into an admirable franchise since. The Patriots under Kraft have been the NFL's most successful franchise since 1994. Since then, the Patriots have appeared in ten Super Bowls, have won six, and had numerous league records established by the franchise.\nHead Coaches.\nThe Patriots have had 14 head coaches throughout their history as a franchise. Bill Belichick has the longest tenure as head coach (23 seasons) with the Patriots, and has been coach since 2000. He has been widely considered one of the greatest coaches of all time, and was named a member of the NFL 100th All-Time Anniversary Team, due to his countless accomplishments with the Patriots. He has specifically led the Patriots to 17 AFC East division titles, 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and nine Super Bowl appearances, with a record six wins.\nBelichick is the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach, as well as the first all-time in playoff coaching wins with 31 and third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 290. He is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles. He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has led the team for more regular season games (336), post-season games (41) and more complete seasons (22) than any other head coach. His 254 wins with the Patriots are far and away the most in franchise history, more than three times those of runner-up Mike Holovak.\nBelichick was acquired in a \"trade\" with the rival New York Jets. Belichick did not want to be under Bill Parcells' authority there in 2000, with uncertainty of his role once their owner, Leon Hess, died. The initial promise was that Belichick would've been granted extreme authority over all of the Jets executive decisions, but when Hess passed away Parcells overruled the stipulation with loopholes, so he would remain in control as GM, leading to Belichick's infamous resignation in 2000. Parcells, a two winning Super Bowl champion coach with the New York Giants (also was an assistant with the Patriots in the early 1980s), had joined New England's staff for the 1993 season to help resurrect the franchise from its dark early 1990s days but had conflicted interests with owner Robert Kraft. In his last year with the Patriots in 1996, Parcells brought in his assistant head coach from his Giants days, Belichick, after being dismissed from coaching five seasons with the Cleveland Browns. Here, Kraft would plant the seeds of a bond between he and Belichick, as Belichick would often mediate issues between Kraft and Parcells. Although Belichick left in 1997 to once again be Parcells assistant in their Jets regime, cold feet about his long-term role there brought him back after negotiating with Kraft, even though he was still under contract with the Jets. The Patriots had technically \"tampered\" in communicating with Belichick. For compensation, the Patriots gave the Jets their first round pick in the 2000 NFL draft, where even without their first round pick, the Patriots would coincidentally draft Tom Brady in the sixth round, widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time and the NFL's greatest draft steal.\nWhile Belichick led the team to nine of their eleven Super Bowl appearances, winning six of them, before him the Patriots saw some championship game appearances. Holovak, Raymond Berry and Parcells all led the Patriots to league championship games, with only one coach failing to reach the Super Bowl. Five Patriots head coaches, Holovak, Chuck Fairbanks, Berry, Parcells, and Belichick, have been named coach of the year by at least one major news organization. The first head coach in franchise history was Lou Saban, who coached them to a 7\u201312\u20130 record in the 1960/1961 season. Additionally, Raymond Berry is a member (as a player) of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1973, eleven years before he became the Patriots' head coach.\nOffensive coordinator history.\nSource:\nDefensive coordinator history.\nSource:\nCulture.\nCheerleaders.\nThe Patriots' professional cheerleading squad is the New England Patriots Cheerleaders which represents the team in the NFL. Notable alumni of the cheerleading squad include wrestler Carmella and model Camille Kostek. Long-time cheerleading director Tracy Sormanti, who was the cheer director since 1994 and had been involved with the organization since 1983, passed away after a three-year battle with multiple myeloma in 2020. She was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2021 as a contributor.\nMascots.\nThe Patriots' official mascot since 1995 has been Pat Patriot, a revolutionary minuteman wearing a Patriots home jersey based off the original logo of the same name.\nThe Patriots also employ a corps known as the End Zone Militia, a group of American Revolutionary War reenactors founded in 1996 by Geoff Campbell, a reenactor for the 9th Massachusetts Regiment (26th Continental Regiment). Consisting of about 30 men and women, they dress 20 for each home game and split themselves into two groups of 10 lining the back of either end zone. When the Patriots score \u2013 whether it be a touchdown, field goal, point-after-touchdown or safety \u2013 the militia behind the opposite end zone fire a volley of blanks from flintlock muskets. Per an interview with the \"Loren &amp; Wally Show\" on WROR 105.7 FM in and around the time of Super Bowl XLIX, said shots use double the load of black powder than a regular historical reenactor does, specifically 200 grains, in order to be heard throughout the stadium. ESPN writer Josh Pahigian named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007.\nEntrance theme.\nOzzy Osbourne's \"Crazy Train\" has become an unofficial theme song and entrance anthem for the Patriots at their home games and Super Bowls, starting when they hosted the NFL Kickoff at Gillette Stadium on September 8, 2005.\nRadio and television.\nThe Patriots' flagship radio station is WBZ-FM (98.5 FM, otherwise known as \"The Sports Hub\"), owned by Beasley Broadcast Group. The larger radio network is called the New England Patriots Radio Network, whose 37 affiliate stations span seven states. Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti were the longtime announcing team until their retirement following the conclusion of the 2012 NFL season. Santos was replaced by Bob Socci. Former Patriots QB Scott Zolak joined the radio team in the 2011 season as a sideline analyst, and in 2013, he replaced Cappelletti as color commentator.\nAny preseason games not on national television are shown on CBS's O&amp;O WBZ-TV, who also airs the bulk of Patriots regular-season games by virtue of CBS having the rights to most AFC games; CBS also has a presence at the nearby Patriot Place with the \"CBS Scene\" bar and restaurant. During the regular season whenever the Patriots host an NFC team, the games are aired on Fox affiliate WFXT-TV, and \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" games are carried by Boston NBC station WBTS-CD. Preseason games were broadcast on ABC affiliate WCVB-TV from 1995 until the change to WBZ in 2009 (WCVB continues to simulcast ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" games featuring the Patriots). Don Criqui was play-by-play announcer for the 1995\u20132012 seasons, with Randy Cross as a color commentator and Mike Lynch as a sideline reporter. Lynch was replaced by WBZ reporter Steve Burton in 2009.\nControversies.\nSnowplow Game.\nDuring a December 12, 1982 home game against the Miami Dolphins under icy conditions, the game remained scoreless until the fourth quarter when Patriots head coach Ron Meyer motioned to snowplow operator Mark Henderson to specifically clear a spot on the field for New England kicker John Smith so he could kick what proved to be the game-winning 33-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3\u20130 win. At the time, an emergency ground rule was put into play where the officials could call time-out and allow the ground crew to use a snowplow to clear the yard markers, but not plow often enough to keep the field clear. Dolphins head coach Don Shula, believing it to be against the league rules, pointed out that the league's unfair act clause allowed the league to overturn it, and met with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle several days later to formally protest the game result. Although Rozelle agreed with Shula that the use of the plow gave the Patriots an unfair advantage, he said that he had never reversed the result of a game and was not going to start doing so for any reason, including cheating. Henderson, a convict on work release, jokingly remarked, \"What are they gonna do, throw me in jail?\"\nThe following year, the NFL banned the use of snowplows on the field during a game. The Patriots has commemorated the game with an exhibit at the Hall at Patriot Place within Gillette Stadium, where the plow itself hangs from the ceiling.\nSpygate.\nDuring the 2007 season, the New England Patriots were disciplined by the league for videotaping New York Jets' defensive coaches' signals from an unauthorized location during a September 9, 2007 game. Videotaping opposing coaches is not illegal in the NFL \"de jure\", but there are designated areas allowed by the league to do such taping. After an investigation, the NFL fined Patriots head coach Bill Belichick $500,000 for his role in the incident, fined the Patriots $250,000, and docked the team their original first-round selection in the 2008 NFL Draft, which would have been the 31st pick of the draft.\nDeflategate.\nDuring the against the Indianapolis Colts, allegations arose that the Patriots were using under-inflated footballs. It was even suggested that the Patriots' staff themselves deliberately deflated the footballs to give their team an unfair advantage during the playoffs. A lengthy investigation and heated debate commenced shortly afterwards, with a full report being published in May 2015. The Wells Report found that balls provided by the Patriots, who were the home team, indeed had less pressure on average than the balls provided by the Colts. Also notable was the findings of some suggestions of communication between Tom Brady and two Patriots locker room attendants, indicating Brady was likely \"generally aware\" of the situation and that the Patriots staff intentionally deflated the footballs. A later study by the American Enterprise Institute called the evidence and methodology of the Wells report \"deeply flawed\" and \"unreliable\".\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the NFL suspended Brady without pay for the first four games of the 2015 season, fined the Patriots $1million, and forced them to forfeit their 2016 first round draft pick and 2017 fourth round draft pick. Brady appealed his suspension, which was eventually vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, only for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reinstate it a year later for the 2016 NFL season. Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI in spite of it.\nNotes and references.\nExplanatory notes\nCitations"}

The Saints compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. Since 1975, the team plays its home games at Caesars Superdome after utilizing Tulane Stadium during its first eight seasons. Founded by John W. Mecom Jr., David Dixon, and the city of New Orleans on November 1, 1966, the Saints joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1967. They are named after the jazz music heritage of New Orleans and the spiritual hymn \"When the Saints Go Marching In\".\nThe Saints were among the NFL's least successful franchises in their first several decades, where they went 20 consecutive seasons without a winning record or qualifying for the playoffs. They earned their first winning record and postseason berth in 1987, while their first playoff win would not occur until 2000, their 34th season. The team's fortunes improved amid the 21st century, especially during the late 2000s and 2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders. Their greatest success to date came in the 2009 season, when they won Super Bowl XLIV over the favored Indianapolis Colts, the team's first and only Super Bowl appearance so far. The Saints are one of two NFL franchises to win their sole Super Bowl appearance, along with the New York Jets, and the most recent to do so.\nFranchise history.\nEarly history.\nLocal sports entrepreneur Dave Dixon and a local civic group had been seeking an NFL franchise for over five years and had hosted record crowds for NFL exhibition games. To seal the NFL-AFL merger, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle arrived in New Orleans within a week, and announced on November 1, 1966, that the NFL officially had awarded the city of New Orleans an expansion franchise. The team was named for \"When the Saints Go Marching In\", the classic jazz standard associated with New Orleans. When the deal was reached a week earlier, Dixon strongly suggested to Rozelle that the announcement be delayed until November 1, to coincide with All Saints' Day. Dixon cleared the name with New Orleans' Archbishop Philip M. Hannan, who \"thought it would be a good idea,\" according to Dixon. \"He had an idea the team was going to need all the help it could get.\"\nJohn Mecom Jr. era (1967-1984).\nBoggs' Congressional committee in turn quickly approved the NFL merger. John W. Mecom Jr., a young oilman from Houston, became the team's first majority stockholder. The team's colors, black and gold, symbolized both Mecom's and New Orleans' strong ties to the oil industry. Trumpeter Al Hirt was part owner of the team, and his rendition of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" was made the official fight song.\nThe inaugural game on September 17, 1967, started with Saints receiverJohn Gilliam returning the opening kickoff 94-yards for a touchdown, in a losing effort, 27\u201313, to the Los Angeles Rams at Tulane Stadium, with over 80,000 in attendance. It was one of the few highlights of a 3\u201311 season, which set an NFL record for most wins by an expansion team.\nFor most of their first 20 years, the Saints finished third or fourth in their division until 1979. Until 1987, the 1979 and 1983 teams were the only ones to finish at .500.\nOne of the franchise's early bright moments came on November 8, 1970, when Tom Dempsey kicked an NFL record-breaking 63-yard field goal at Tulane Stadium to defeat the Detroit Lions 19\u201317 in the final seconds of the game; the previous record was seven yards less, set in . Dempsey's record was not broken until by Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos, who kicked one yard farther.\nIn 1980, the Saints lost their first 14 games, prompting local sportscaster Bernard \"Buddy D\" Diliberto to advise Saints supporters to wear paper bags over their heads at the team's home games; many bags rendered the club's name as the \"'Aints\" rather than the \"Saints.\"\nBenson era (1985-present).\nJim E. Mora years (1986\u20131996).\nTom Benson, a successful automobile dealership owner and banker, acquired the franchise in 1985, and hired Jim Finks as general manager and Jim Mora as head coach. That combination provided the Saints with their first-ever winning record and playoff appearance, going 12\u20133 in 1987, which had one fewer game than normal due to a players' strike. Another playoff berth would follow during the 1990 season, and the club's first division title came in 1991. During Mora's tenure, the Saints made the playoffs four times, with teams marked by strong defenses led by the \"Dome Patrol\" linebacking corps, but they were never able to win a playoff game. Mora coached the Saints until the middle of the 1996 season, when he stepped down halfway through the 3\u201313 season. His 93 wins were three more than the Saints won in their entire history prior to his arrival, and would remain the most for any Saints coach until 2016.\nMike Ditka years (1997\u20131999).\nAfter the end of the 1996 season, ironically as Diliberto had suggested before Mora's resignation, former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka was hired to replace Mora. Although this initially generated a lot of excitement among Saints fans, Ditka's tenure ended up being a failure. The Saints went 6\u201310 in their first two seasons under Ditka (1997 and 1998). During the 1999 NFL Draft, Ditka traded all of his picks for that season, as well as the first-round and third-round picks for the following season, to the Washington Redskins in order to draft University of Texas Heisman Trophy running back Ricky Williams in the first round. Ditka and Williams had a mock wedding picture taken to commemorate the occasion. However, Ditka, most of his coaching staff, and general manager Bill Kuharich were fired at the end of the 1999 season due to the club's 3\u201313 record.\nJim Haslett years (2000\u20132005).\nJim Haslett held the post from 2000 to 2005. In his first year, he took the team to the 2000 playoffs and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams for the team's first-ever playoff win. The team lost the following week to the Minnesota Vikings. After winning the 2000 NFL Executive of the Year Award, General Manager Randy Mueller was fired between the 2001 and 2002 seasons without explanation by Benson. The Saints failed to make the playoffs in 2001 and 2002, although in the latter year they had the distinction of beating the eventual Super Bowl XXXVII champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in both of their regular-season meetings, only the second team to do so in NFL history.\nIn 2003, the Saints again missed the playoffs after finishing 8\u20138. The 2004 season started poorly for the Saints, as they went 2\u20134 through their first six games and 4\u20138 through their first twelve games. At that point Haslett's job appeared to be in jeopardy; however, he managed to win the three straight games leading up to the season finale, leaving the Saints in playoff contention in the final week of the season. In week 17, the Saints defeated division rivals Carolina; however, the Saints needed other results to break their way and when the St. Louis Rams beat the New York Jets the Saints were eliminated despite having beaten the Rams, who finished with the same record. The Rams, Saints, and Vikings all were 8\u20138, with the Rams having a 7\u20135 conference record, Saints 6\u20136, and the Vikings 5\u20137. The Rams received the number 1 wild-card due to having the best conference record out of the three, followed by the Vikings due to the 38\u201331 loss handed to the Saints in Week 6. Haslett was fired after the 2005 season, in which the Saints finished 3\u201313 and did not play any regular-season games in New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina.\nEffect of Hurricane Katrina.\nDue to the damage Hurricane Katrina caused to the Superdome and the New Orleans area, the Saints' scheduled 2005 home opener against the New York Giants was moved to Giants Stadium. The remainder of their 2005 home games were split between the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, and LSU's Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge.\nSean Payton years (2006\u20132021).\nOn January 17, 2006, the Saints hired Sean Payton as their new head coach and, on March 14, signed former San Diego Chargers quarterback Drew Brees to a six-year, $60 million deal.\nOn March 23, the Saints announced that the team's two 2006 preseason games were to be played at Shreveport, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi. After a $185 million renovation of the historic stadium, on April 6 the Saints released their 2006 schedule, with all home games scheduled to be played at the Superdome. On September 19, Saints owner Tom Benson announced that the team had sold out the Louisiana Superdome for the entire season with season tickets alone (68,354 seats), a first in franchise history.\nThe September 25, home opener, the first home game in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, was won by the Saints 23\u20133 against the Atlanta Falcons, who were undefeated in the 2006 season at that time. The attendance for the game was a sellout crowd of 70,003. Meanwhile, the broadcast of the game was ESPN's highest-ever rated program to date, with an 11.8 rating, and viewership by 10.85 million homes. It was the most-watched program for the night, broadcast or cable, and was the second-highest rated cable program of all time at the time. Green Day and U2 performed \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" and \"The Saints Are Coming\", respectively, before the game. The game received a 2007 ESPY award for \"Best Moment in Sports.\" The game is remembered by Saints fans for Steve Gleason's blocked punt on the opening series that resulted in a touchdown for New Orleans.\nOn December 17, the Saints clinched their third division title and their first NFC South title in franchise history. For the first time in Saints' history, they clinched their NFC South title on their home field. Sean Payton became the second consecutive Saints coach to win a division title in his first season. After the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Dallas Cowboys 23\u20137 on Christmas Day 2006, the Saints clinched a first-round playoff bye for the first time in franchise history, finishing the regular season with a record of 10\u20136.\nAfter the first-round bye, the Saints beat the Philadelphia Eagles 27\u201324 in the Superdome in the 2006 Divisional Playoffs. No team had ever had such a poor record in the prior year (3\u201313) and then gone on to a league or conference championship game since the 1999 St. Louis Rams who advanced to win their first Super Bowl after being 4\u201312 the season before. Since the Saints' only previous playoff win was in the wild card round, this was the farthest the Saints had ever advanced at the time. The victory was only the second playoff win in team history. The season ended on January 21, 2007, when the Saints lost 39\u201314 to the Chicago Bears in the NFC Championship game.\nThe Saints announced that for the second year in a row, the Louisiana Superdome had sold out every ticket for the season. Additionally, all luxury boxes had been sold out for the season. Both of these statistics are particularly surprising given that the city-proper has about 300,000 people or 150,000 fewer people than July 2005 population data (though the metro area still accounts for 1.2 million people).\nThe first game of the season was against the defending Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts. The Saints lost this game, 41\u201310, and lost their next three games. In one of these three games, against the Tennessee Titans, the Saints lost running back Deuce McAllister for the season with his second career (second time in three seasons) ACL tear. After winning their first game, against the Seattle Seahawks, two weeks later, the team went on a four-game winning streak to bring their record to an even 4\u20134. After reaching 7\u20137, the Saints lost their final two games to finish 7\u20139.\nFollowing a disappointing 7\u20139 record in the 2007 season, the Saints ended the 2008 season 8\u20138. Failing to qualify for the post-season for the second straight year, the Saints found themselves struggling on defense. However, the Saints would match the explosive offense they had in the 2006 season. Drew Brees ended the 2008 season just 16 yards short of beating Dan Marino's single-season record of 5084 total passing yards, and receiver Lance Moore came 72 yards short of his first 1000-yard season.\nSuper Bowl XLIV champions (2009).\nThe 2009 season was the team's most successful season, which culminated in the franchise's first league championship win against the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV. After achieving a record of 13\u20130 with their win over the Atlanta Falcons, it marked the Saints' best start to a season in its franchise history. The result clinched an NFC playoff berth, a bye in the first round of the playoffs. By winning their first 13 games, the Saints also set the record for the longest undefeated season opening (13\u20130) by an NFC team since the AFL\u2013NFL merger, surpassing the previous record (12\u20130) held by the 1985 Chicago Bears. However, they would fall victim to the Dallas Cowboys in week 14, going on to end the season with a three-game losing streak. The Saints became the first team to win a Super Bowl after losing its last three regular-season games.\nAlthough its opponents would include winners of 9 of the last 15 NFL MVP awards, the team advanced to the 2009 NFC Championship game where they defeated the Minnesota Vikings, led by Brett Favre, 31\u201328 in overtime, advancing to their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Television ratings for Super Bowl XLIV (44) were the second highest for any TV program, sports or otherwise, in history, as their successful bid to win the Super Bowl was seen by many to represent the city's resurgence after the devastating Hurricane Katrina.\nThe Saints' 2010 season began in the Superdome as the defending Super Bowl champions defeated the Minnesota Vikings 14\u20139, in a rematch of the 2009 NFC Championship Game. It was played on Thursday, September 9, 2010, and televised on NBC, making it the first time the Saints have opened the NFL's season at home. On Sunday, August 8, 2010, NBC announced the televised opening festivities of the evening would begin with Taylor Swift and Dave Matthews Band. On December 27, 2010, with a 17\u201314 win against the Atlanta Falcons in Atlanta, the Saints clinched a playoff appearance (wild card). This marked the first time a team in the NFC South had made back-to-back playoff appearances since the division was formed in 2002. The Saints would face the Seattle Seahawks for the wild-card opener at Qwest Field. The Seahawks were the first NFL team to capture their division with a sub-.500 regular-season record (7\u20139). Drew Brees completed a postseason-record 39 passes for 404 yards and two touchdowns. Despite throwing 60 passes and hindered by a lack of depth at running back, last year's Super Bowl MVP was not intercepted and rallied the Saints within 34\u201330 in the fourth quarter. In the end, his efforts were negated by a defense that could not get enough stops and a late touchdown run by Marshawn Lynch breaking over a half-dozen tackles with 3:22 left which helped the Seahawks defeat the Saints 41\u201336.\nThe Saints began their season with a loss against the Green Bay Packers, but the team rebounded for the next four weeks to bring their record to 4\u20131. A loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers brought the record to 4\u20132, but the team bounced back with a 62\u20137 blowout win against the struggling Indianapolis Colts. A surprise loss to the St. Louis Rams resulted in the record dropping to 5\u20133. In the next seven weeks the Saints beat talented teams such as the eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants, Detroit Lions, and Atlanta Falcons, bringing their season record to 12\u20133. To cap off the season, quarterback Drew Brees broke the single-season passing record held for over 25 years, on the way to a Saints division-winning game. The Saints won the NFC South title on December 26 and ended the 2011 season as the third seed in the NFC. They finished with a 13\u20133 record, beating Carolina 45\u201317 and also giving running back Darren Sproles the record for most all-purpose yards in a single season. The team broke numerous records that year including most yards in a season, completion percentage, yards passing, completions and more. The New Orleans Saints beat the Detroit Lions in the 2011 NFC wild-card playoff game 45\u201328. New Orleans also tied the NFL's postseason mark for team first downs in a game (34), and broke the record for total yards with 626, eclipsing the yardage record set 49 years ago. The Saints lost in the Divisional round in the playoffs against the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park that featured the Saints losing two leads in the last four minutes of regulation.\nAfter an off-season dominated by the bounty scandal and the year-long suspension of head coach Sean Payton, the Saints sought to refocus on football and produce yet another winning year. Instead, the team, led by offensive line coach Aaron Kromer for its first six games, started the season with four straight losses and a last-place spot in the NFC South. The team finally broke through with a win in Week 5, against the San Diego Chargers, a game that also saw quarterback Drew Brees break Johnny Unitas's longstanding record for consecutive games with a touchdown pass. After their bye week, the Saints went on to win 4 of their next 5 games, to bring their record to an even 5\u20135. Joe Vitt returned after his six-game suspension to serve as interim head coach for the rest of the season. The team failed to hold its momentum however, and lost the next three games, including a loss at Atlanta that also marked the end of Brees' record touchdown streak after 54 games, and a 52\u201327 blowout loss to the Giants that dropped the Saints to 5\u20138. Despite winning 2 of their last 3 games, and Brees again leading the league with 5,177 passing yards (his third time to surpass 5,000 yards, as he remained the only quarterback to break that barrier more than once), the team finished third in the NFC South, at 7\u20139. The Saints defense allowed 7,042 yards, setting an NFL record.\nThe Saints finished their 2013 preseason 3\u20131, and won their first five regular-season games against the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Arizona Cardinals, Miami Dolphins and Chicago Bears. The Saints under Sean Peyton had been winless in Chicago's Soldier Field and had not won in the Windy City since 2000. The Saints fared well against Chicago, Arizona and Miami, winning 26\u201318, 31\u20137 and 38\u201317 respectively, but needed a 4th down shutdown and a last-minute field goal to escape Atlanta and Tampa Bay. The Saints went on a 5\u20130 win streak, but were stopped short by the New England Patriots in Week 6, losing 30\u201327, with a touchdown pass by Tom Brady in the last 5 seconds of the game. New Orleans would go undefeated at home for the second straight season with Sean Payton as the head coach, but finish just 3\u20135 on the road. Key losses included a 7\u201334 blowout against the Seattle Seahawks on Monday Night Football in Seattle which cost them homefield advantage throughout the playoffs, a 16\u201327 upset against the St. Louis Rams in St. Louis which led to the Saints needing to win their next game against Carolina to control their own playoff destiny, and a heartbreaking 13\u201317 defeat to their division rival the Carolina Panthers in Charlotte who went on to win the NFC South. The Saints finished the season with an 11\u20135 record and earned a wild card berth as the sixth seed in the NFC. On January 4, 2014, the Saints recorded their first road playoff win in franchise history over the Philadelphia Eagles 26\u201324. On January 11, the Saints lost to the first seed, the Seattle Seahawks, once again in Seattle 15\u201323. The weather conditions were very poor, which gave the offense much difficulty. Despite the conditions, the defense of the Saints played well, holding Seattle to just 23 over the 34 points allowed against Seattle during the regular season.\nThe Saints finished the season 7\u20139, second in their division behind the 7\u20138\u20131 Carolina Panthers. They missed out on the playoffs after being defeated 14\u201330 by their divisional rival, the Atlanta Falcons, in the second-to-last week of the season. This season was notorious in Saints history for having the 31st worst-ranked defense in the league, which is one of the main reasons for the Saints' poor 2014 campaign. The only two great performances by the defense out of the entire season came from a 44\u201323 home win against the Green Bay Packers and a 31\u201315 victory against the Chicago Bears in Chicago.\nThe Saints finished with a 7\u20139 record for the second consecutive season. They were third in the NFC South after the 15\u20131 NFC champions Carolina Panthers and the 8\u20138 Atlanta Falcons. Their defense was historically bad. They allowed the most passing touchdowns in a season in NFL history as they allowed 45, effectively making them the worst passing defense in NFL history. They also set the NFL record in opposing passer rating (116.2), while finishing last in points allowed (29.8) and yards allowed per play (6.6). Atrocious play by defensive captain Brandon Browner, who set the NFL record for most penalties with 23, did not help the struggling Saints defense. Defensive coordinator Rob Ryan was fired near the half-way point in the season and was replaced by senior defensive assistant Dennis Allen. The Saints had strong play from their 2015 draft class. The Saints' first pick Andrus Peat started at right tackle and left guard at certain points in the season, and other first-round pick Stephone Anthony finished his rookie season with 112 tackles, one sack, one interception, and two forced fumbles. He had two scores, both coming against the Carolina Panthers and led all rookies in tackles. Second-round pick Hau'oli Kikaha had 4 sacks. Canadian football star Delvin Breaux, who was signed in the off-season, led the Saints struggling secondary with 3 interceptions and 19 pass deflections. Drew Brees also tied the NFL record for touchdown passes in a game with 7, coming against the New York Giants.\nThe Saints finished with a 7\u20139 record for the third consecutive season, their offense finished first in the NFL in yards per game (426.0), second in points per game (29.3), and third in yards per play (6.2). Brees led the NFL in passing yards with 5,208. However the defense yet again struggled mightily, as they were allowed the 2nd most points per game (28.4) and 6th most yards per game (375.4) while being tied for 2nd worst in yards per play allowed (6.0).\nDespite an 0\u20132 start to the season, the Saints proceeded to win their next 8 games en route to an 11\u20135 finish, winning their first NFC South title since 2011. The Saints' turnaround was largely attributable to their draft, where they drafted cornerback Marshon Lattimore, offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk, safety Marcus Williams, and running back Alvin Kamara. It is widely considered one of the best draft classes in NFL history. The defense drastically improved, as they allowed just 20.4 points per game while finishing third in the league with 20 interceptions. The offense continued to be excellent, finishing second in yards per game (391.2) and fourth in points per game (28.0).\nIn the wild card round, the Saints defeated the Carolina Panthers in the wild-card round, 31\u201326. However, in the divisional round, the Saints lost 29\u201324 to the Minnesota Vikings after a stunning finish in which Vikings quarterback Case Keenum completed a pass towards the sideline to Stefon Diggs, then Marcus Williams missed a tackle and Diggs was able to run to the end zone for a 61-yard touchdown with no time left on the clock.\nOn March 15, 2018, the Saints' owner Tom Benson died from flu at the age of 90 after he was hospitalized on February 16, 2018. Benson's wife Gayle Benson succeeded him as the owner of the Saints and the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans.\nOn January 25, 2022, Sean Payton announced to the team that he was stepping away as head coach after 15 seasons with the team. During his tenure as head coach, the Saints went 152-89 in the regular season and 9-8 in the postseason.\nDennis Allen years (2022-present).\nThe team promoted defensive coordinator, Dennis Allen to head coach on February 8, 2022.\nOn November 14, 2022, after a 3-7 start, disappointed Saints fans started a petition on change.org, asking to relieve Dennis Allen of his duties.\nLogos and uniforms.\nBlack, along with old gold and white, has always been one of the team colors, but it was not the first choice of original majority owner John W. Mecom Jr. His preference was for Mecom blue, a medium shade which was used by all of his other investments. The NFL office, however, informed him that his proposed combination too closely resembled that worn by the San Diego Chargers. Although the Chargers were members of the AFL, the older league did not want to offend its soon-to-be partner so soon after the merger. Mecom settled on black as the primary color as a nod to his financial involvement in the petroleum industry. \"Black gold\" is a term synonymous with oil. Although the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2014who played a few home games in New Orleans during their early years to avoid conflict with the Pittsburgh Panthers football team\u2014have long used black and gold as their colors, their shade of gold more closely resembles yellow, making the Saints black and gold compatible with the rest of the NFL.\nExcept for minor modifications, the Saints' logo and uniforms have basically remained the same since the club debuted in 1967. The team's logo is a fleur-de-lis (a symbol of the City of New Orleans and of France's Royal Family, which included the House of Bourbon), while its uniform design consists of gold helmets, gold pants, and either black or white jerseys. Minor changes to the uniform stripes and trim have been made throughout the years. The team wore black helmets during the 1969 preseason, but NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle barred the Saints from using the helmets during the regular season, since Mecom did not notify the league office of the change. Black helmets were not introduced until 2022, after the NFL repealed its \"one-helmet rule\" previously enforced in 2013.\nThe Saints predominantly wore white at home when the club played at Tulane Stadium from 1967 through 1974 (except in 1969 and 1970), forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys in the subtropical climate of New Orleans. When the surface at Tulane Stadium switched from natural grass to PolyTurf in 1971, field temperatures became hotter still. In Archie Manning's first game, in the 1971 season opener against the Los Angeles Rams, temperatures on the field reached as high as . The heavily favored Rams wilted in the stifling heat, and the Saints claimed their first-ever victory over their NFC West rivals, 24\u201320, on Manning's one-yard quarterback sneak on the last play of the game.\nThe Saints switched to white pants in 1975, coinciding with the team's move from Tulane Stadium to the Superdome, and have worn white at home numerous times since then. One year later, they started to wear black pants with their white jerseys, a move influenced by coach Hank Stram, who introduced red pants to the Kansas City Chiefs' uniforms in 1968. In an October 3, 1976 home game against the Houston Oilers, Hank Stram used the Saints' road uniforms, the white jerseys and black pants. The Saints lost that game 31\u201326. During the 1981\u201382 seasons (Bum Phillips' first two seasons as coach), the team wore white jerseys with black pants at home, but reverted to the black jerseys and white pants for 1983. They reverted to wearing gold pants with both their black and white jerseys in 1986 under new coach Jim E. Mora. From 1986 through 1995, the sleeves of the jerseys and sides of the pants featured a logo with a fleur-de-lis inside an outline of the state of Louisiana (with the location of New Orleans marked with a star in the state outline). The logo replaced the striping pattern that had been on the uniforms since the team's inception; save for color variations, the striping pattern was similar to that used by the Washington Redskins (until 1979), Green Bay Packers (until 1997), and Cleveland Browns (until 2014), which is likely why the change was made. That logo was removed in 1996 and replaced with a fleur-de-lis on both the sleeves and sides of the pants.\nFrom 1996 through 1998, the Saints returned to gold numbers on both the white and black jerseys, but complaints about the numbers on the white jerseys being too difficult to read forced the numbers on the white jerseys to be changed to black in 1999. The Saints wore black pants with a wide gold stripe with their white jerseys in 1999, but following a 3\u201313 season and the dismissal of coach Mike Ditka, the black pants were mothballed by new coach Jim Haslett.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, the Saints won their first playoff game as they hosted the St. Louis Rams, and after having a better road record than home record, they wore their white jerseys, and won 31\u201328 over the defending champion Rams. The defining play of the game came with the Saints clinging to a three-point lead with minutes to play. The Saints punted to the Rams' Az-Zahir Hakim (who would play one season for the Saints in 2005), who fumbled the punt deep in Rams' territory. Brian Milne recovered for the Saints, who then ran out the clock to preserve the victory.\nIn 2001, they wore their white jerseys in the first six home games. During that same year, they primarily wore black pants with both their white and black jerseys. They became the first NFL team to wear all-black uniforms in a Week 5 road game against the Carolina Panthers, and again in weeks 16 and 17 in home games against the Washington Redskins and San Francisco 49ers; the Saints were outscored 78\u201310 in the final two contests to end a 7\u20139 campaign.\nIn 2002, the Saints wore black pants with their white jerseys (except for the final road game, a 20\u201313 loss in Cincinnati when they went back to the gold pants), and gold pants with their black jerseys, a gold alternate jersey, and a 1967-style throwback uniform, complete with an accurate 1967-era helmet which featured a larger fleur-de-lis, a darker shade of gold and grey facemasks. But one season later, they stopped using the alternates and again reverted to wearing gold pants with both their black and white jerseys.\nThe team introduced a gold alternate jersey (worn with the black pants) during a December 15, 2002 game versus the Minnesota Vikings, a 32\u201331 loss, but have never worn them since then. Because of the metallic gold's bright color, the gold jerseys were considered the \"light\" jersey in the game, so the Vikings wore their purple home jerseys as the \"dark\" colored team. One team must wear \"dark\" and one team must wear \"light\", this was done because of black &amp; white t.v. broadcasts so viewers could tell the teams apart. The only exception being if both teams are wearing throwback uniforms, such as Thanksgiving Classic games. From 2003 through 2007, the New England Patriots had a \"light\" jersey (their alternate, a bright metallic silver) that is not white in which the other team would wear their colored, or \"dark\" jerseys against them since the third jersey rule was implemented in the NFL in 2002.\nThe Saints also introduced a 1967-style throwback uniform in a 23\u201320 win on December 1, 2002, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This uniform was not worn again until a 40\u201333 win against the Houston Texans on September 25, 2011, and also on November 6, 2011, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 27\u201316 Saints win. However, the 2011 throwbacks use the current helmet, meaning the shades of gold on the helmet and jersey do not match. This uniform was brought back on December 4, 2016, a 28\u201313 loss to the Detroit Tigers, in commemoration of the franchise's 50th season. It was then shelved for five seasons before returning on November 21, 2022 against the Los Angeles Rams.\nIn 2006, to honor their return to Louisiana, the Saints wore a patch on their uniforms with an outline of the State of Louisiana with a fleur-de-lis superimposed, similar to the logo from the 1980s.\nThe Saints originally planned to wear white jerseys at home for the 2006 season, but during the season, the players voted to wear the black jerseys at home after the second game. Since the team had informed the NFL office that they planned to wear white jerseys at home, each of the Saints' remaining home opponents would have to agree to New Orleans' request. The Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Cincinnati Bengals did not agree to the switch, forcing the Saints to wear white jerseys for those games.\nStarting in week 13 of the 2006 season, the Saints wore black pants with the black jerseys against the San Francisco 49ers (restoring them after a four-season absence), and in a Week 16 game in The Meadowlands against the New York Giants (a 30\u20137 Saints win), the Saints wore the black pants with their road white jerseys. The Saints later stuck with the black pants in their 2006 playoff run.\nSince 2008, the Saints have worn white jerseys at home for preseason games and early regular-season home games.\nIn 2009, the Saints wore the black pants only once, beating St. Louis 28\u201323. They wore the white jerseys/gold pants combination during the Super Bowl XLIV victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In 2012 and 2014, the Saints wore black pants 12 times and wore gold pants 4 times. In 2013, gold pants were used only 7 times (including playoffs). After 2015, a season in which the gold pants were donned 10 times, the Saints only wore them sporadically in the regular season, though they were still used regularly in the preseason.\nPrior to the 2016 season, the NFL introduced the Color Rush program, and the Saints' version is a mixture of different uniform designs from earlier eras. White jersey tops featured old gold numbers with black trim along with gold and black sleeve stripes (a nod to the team's late 1960s uniforms). Complementing the uniforms were white pants (inspired from the 1975\u201385 look) and all-white socks. The Saints first wore the uniform during Week 11 of that season against the Carolina Panthers on the road, and was worn on the road two more times thereafter. Its first home appearance came in Week 11 of the 2018 season against the Philadelphia Eagles; the Saints were forced to wear the white uniforms at home after head coach Sean Payton lost a bet with Eagles coach Doug Pederson during a charity golf event in the offseason.\nIn 2019, a variation of the all-white Color Rush look was unveiled during the Week 6 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Saints wore their current white uniforms, but paired them with white pants minus any striping (an inverse of their black pants). During the regular season, New Orleans went undefeated (8\u20130) while wearing either all-white uniform. As a result, they opted to wear the new all-white look at home during the against the Minnesota Vikings. However, the Saints' luck finally ran out, losing in overtime 26\u201320. On December 24, 2022, the Saints wore another variation of the all-white uniform, this time wearing black socks at the Cleveland Browns.\nIn 2022, the Saints unveiled an alternate black helmet, featuring a gold fleur-de-lis on each side and a triangle pattern of tiny gold fleur-de-lis logos. The helmets are worn with the Color Rush uniforms. The black helmets made its official regular season debut in an NFL London Game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium against the Minnesota Vikings on October 2, 2022.\nStadium.\nCaesars Superdome is the Saints' home stadium. It has a listed seating capacity of 76,468 (expanded) or 73,208 (not expanded). The Saints own a perfect record there against the Houston Texans (2\u20130) and Jacksonville Jaguars (3\u20130), but a winless one against the Baltimore Ravens (0\u20132).\nRivals.\nDivisional rivals.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nThe Saints' oldest rival are the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons lead the rivalry series 53\u201351. The two clubs joined the NFL within a year of each other as expansion teams and have played each other twice a season since the Saints joined the league in 1967.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThe Saints have a developing rivalry with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who have been part of the NFC South with the Saints since 2002, and the Saints lead the overall series, 38\u201321.\nThe teams actually played each other quite often as non-division rivals. Between 1977 and 2001, there were only five years in which the teams did not play. This includes 12 years in a row from 1981 to 1992 \u2013 all as a result of the scheduling formulas in place prior to 2002 (this remains a record for most consecutive years in which two teams not from the same division met each other).\nThe Saints won 13 of 20 games as non-division opponents. Since becoming division rivals, the Saints have the edge in the series, winning 16 games to the Bucs' 10.\nOne notable pre-division game is a 1977 matchup that resulted in Tampa Bay's first win in franchise history coming against New Orleans after previously starting out 0\u201326 overall.\nOn January 17, 2021, the two teams faced off in the playoffs for the first time in their rivalry history with Tampa Bay winning 30\u201320, despite New Orleans beating Tampa Bay twice in the regular season.\nCarolina Panthers.\nThe Saints and the Carolina Panthers have been division rivals since Carolina joined the league as an expansion franchise in 1995, first in the NFC West and then in the NFC South since 2002. An extremely close series, the Saints hold the head-to-head advantage 28\u201325, including a Wild Card victory in 2017.\nCarolina defeated New Orleans on the road every year from 2002 to 2008, a streak of seven seasons. Notable games include Carolina's 19\u20137 home victory in 1996 that sparked Saints head coach Jim Mora's infamous \"Diddley Poo\" rant and resignation from the team, Carolina's 10\u20136 win in the 2002 season finale at the Superdome to knock the Saints out of the playoffs, and the emotional 2005 season opener at Carolina where the Saints won 23\u201320 in the face of Hurricane Katrina and an eventual 3\u201313 season.\nIn their last game in the 2014 NFL season, a fight between players broke out in the end zone and spilled out into the tunnel entrance after a Cam Newton touchdown, with Panther's tight end Brandon Williams getting ejected and both teams receiving offsetting penalties. The Panthers won the contest 41\u201310, with early turnovers by the Saints being a factor in the blowout.\nOn January 7, 2018, the two teams met in the NFL playoffs for the first time in the Wild Card round. It was the first ever playoff game between NFC South teams since the division's formation in 2002. The Saints beat the Panthers 31\u201326, thus eliminating Carolina.\nNon-division rivals.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nThe Saints have developed a strong rivalry with the Minnesota Vikings as they have met in many consequential regular-season and playoff games. The Vikings lead the overall series 23\u201313 with a 4\u20131 record in the playoffs.\nStatistics.\nRecord vs. opponents.\n! Total !! 402 !! 461 !! 5 !! !! colspan=\"4\"|\n! Total including playoffs !! 412 !! 474 !! 5 !! !! colspan=\"4\"|\nNotable players.\nPro Football Hall of Famers.\nUntil the selection of Rickey Jackson in 2010, there had been no players in the Hall of Fame who earned their credentials primarily as Saints; the others were chosen for their work with previous teams. Jim Finks\u2019 tenure as Saints general manager was a significant factor in his selection.\nWhen offensive tackle Willie Roaf was selected in 2012, he became the second Saint to earn his Hall of Fame credentials mostly while in New Orleans. Roaf was a member of the NFL's All-Decade team of the '90s. Morten Andersen was selected in 2017, becoming the third former player inducted primarily for their accomplishments in New Orleans. Andersen was only the second full-time placekicker inducted into the Hall of Fame (the other was Jan Stenerud in 1991).\nPro Bowl players.\nThe following Saints players have been named to at least one Pro Bowl:\nTwo Saints head coaches have participated in the Pro Bowl, Tom Fears in 1970 (1969 season) and Sean Payton in 2007 (2006 season) and 2018 (2017 season).\nRing of Honor.\nOn October 9, 2013, the Saints announced the creation of a Ring of Honor to commemorate former players, administrators and individuals with significant contributions to the franchise. Their names are displayed along the Caesars Superdome's Terrace Level fascia. The first three honorees were Archie Manning, Rickey Jackson and Willie Roaf and were officially inducted during halftime of the Saints' game against the Dallas Cowboys on November 10, 2013.\n45th Anniversary Team.\nTo commemorate the club's 45th anniversary, the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame selected its All-45th Anniversary Team. The Hall of Fame updates its all-time team every five years, and this latest squad of head coach and players features four standouts from the club's roster at the time of selection: QB Drew Brees, G Jahri Evans, and DE Will Smith as well as head coach Sean Payton. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nThe players are chosen in a vote by the Hall of Fame media selection committee, which includes local and regional media members who cover the Saints now or did so in the past. The All-45th Anniversary Team is as follows, with an asterisk (*) designating those players who have already been inducted into the Hall of Fame:\nOffense\nSpecialists\nDefense\nCoach\n Unanimous selection\nNew Orleans Saints Hall of Fame.\n1 2005 induction ceremonies postponed to October 27, 2006, due to Hurricane Katrina\nJoe Gemelli Fleur-De-Lis Award.\nThe \"Joe Gemelli Fleur-De-Lis Award\" is given yearly to a person who has contributed to the betterment of the New Orleans Saints organization. The award is named for Joe Gemelli, a New Orleans clothing store owner and an active supporter of sports in the city, who was known as the team's biggest fan.\nCheerleaders.\nThe Saintsations are the cheerleading squad for the Saints. A cheerleading squad has existed since the franchise's founding, but the current name was only adopted in 1987.\nRadio and television.\nThe Saints' flagship station is WWL (870 AM/105.3 FM), one of the oldest radio stations in the city of New Orleans and one of the nation's most powerful as a clear-channel station with 50,000 watts of power. Longtime WWL-TV reporter and anchor Mike Hoss is the play-by-play announcer, with former Saints running back Deuce McAllister as color commentator. Hoss succeeded former Saints guard Zach Strief when Strief was named to the Saints' coaching staff in the spring of 2021.\nStrief succeeded longtime play-by-play announcer Jim Henderson in 2018, and McAllister succeeded another former Saints running back, Hokie Gajan, in the role after Gajan's death on April 11, 2016, from liposarcoma. Henderson was the play-by-play announcer for Saints radio broadcasts continuously from 1993 to 2017, and previously held the position from 1986 to 1989 after serving as a color commentator from 1981 to 1985, and again in 1992, when Dave Garrett was play-by-play announcer. Previous color commentators include former Saints players Jim Taylor (RB, 1967), Steve Stonebreaker (LB, 1967\u201368), Danny Abramowicz (WR, 1967\u201373), Archie Manning (QB, 1971\u201382) and Stan Brock (OT, 1980\u201391).\nMost preseason games are televised by WVUE (Channel 8), a station which until its outright 2017 sale to Raycom Media (and subsequent sale in 2019 to Gray Television) was owned by a consortium led by Saints owner Tom Benson since mid-2008 (that consortium, now led by Gayle Benson, continues to hold a minority stake in the station). As the Fox affiliate for New Orleans, it carries the majority of Saints games; WVUE also carries a heavy complement of coach and player shows. Tim Brando and Jon Stinchcomb call the preseason games for the Saints.\nSaints preseason games were previously produced by Cox Sports Television. Beginning in the 2015 season, owing to Raycom's management of the station on behalf of Tom Benson's ownership group, production of preseason telecasts were taken over by Raycom Sports under a new multi-year deal, and syndicated to Raycom stations and others around the team's footprint. Regular season games are also aired on WWL-TV, the local CBS station whenever they host an AFC opponent (and games vs. NFC opponents cross-flexed from Fox to CBS) and NBC affiliate WDSU via \"Sunday Night Football\", with the latter also syndicating \"Monday Night Football\" games for local airing from sister operation ESPN."}
{"id": "21721", "revid": "19992876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21721", "title": "New York Jets", "text": "The New York Jets are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area. The Jets compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Jets play their home games at MetLife Stadium (shared with the New York Giants) in East Rutherford, New Jersey, west of New York City. The team is headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey. The franchise is legally organized as a limited liability company under the name New York Jets, LLC.\nThe team was founded in 1959 as the Titans of New York, an original member of the American Football League (AFL); later, the franchise joined the NFL in the AFL\u2013NFL merger in . The team began play in 1960 at the Polo Grounds. Under new ownership, the current name was adopted in 1963 and the franchise moved to Shea Stadium in 1964 and then to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in 1984. The Jets advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 1968 and went on to compete in Super Bowl III where they defeated the Baltimore Colts, becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club in an AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game. Since 1968, the Jets have appeared in the playoffs 13 times, and in the AFC Championship Game four times, most recently losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010. However, the Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl, making them one of two NFL teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance, along with the New Orleans Saints, and making them one of four teams (along with the Cleveland Browns, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans) to never win an AFC championship. Apart from the Browns and the Detroit Lions, who have never reached the Super Bowl (although both won NFL championships prior to 1966), the Jets' drought is the longest among current NFL franchises and they are historically among the less successful franchises.\nThe team's training facility, Atlantic Health Jets Training Center, which opened in 2008, is located in Florham Park.\nFranchise history.\nThe first organizational meeting of the American Football League took place on August 14, 1959. Harry Wismer, representing the city of New York at the meeting, proclaimed the state was ready for another professional football team and that he was more than capable of running the daily operations.\nWismer was granted the charter franchise later dubbed the Titans of New York as Wismer explained, \"Titans are bigger and stronger than Giants.\" He secured the Titans' home field at the decrepit Polo Grounds, where the team struggled financially and on the field during its first three years. By 1962, the debt continued to mount for Wismer, forcing the AFL to assume the costs of the team until season's end.\nA five-man syndicate, headed by Sonny Werblin, saved the team from certain bankruptcy, purchasing the lowly Titans for $1\u00a0million in 1963. Werblin renamed the team the New York Jets since the team would play near LaGuardia Airport and because it rhymed with the New York Mets as they would be playing in Shea Stadium. The new name was intended to reflect the modern approach of his team. The Jets' owners hired Weeb Ewbank as the general manager and head coach. Ewbank and quarterback Joe Namath led the Jets to prominence in 1969, when New York defeated the heavily favored Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III and solidified the AFL's position in the world of professional football.\nWhen the AFL and NFL merged, the team fell into a state of mediocrity along with their star quarterback, Namath, who only had three successful post-merger seasons after injuries hampered much of his career. The Jets continued to spiral downward before enjoying a string of successes in the 1980s, which included an appearance in the 1982 AFC Championship Game, and the emergence of the popular New York Sack Exchange.\nThe early 1990s saw the team struggling. After firing coach Bruce Coslet, owner Leon Hess hired Pete Carroll who struggled to a 6\u201310 record and was promptly fired at the end of the season. Thereafter, Rich Kotite was selected to lead the team to victory; instead he led the Jets to a 4\u201328 record over the next two years. Kotite stepped down at the end of his second season forcing the Jets to search for a new head coach.\nHess lured then-disgruntled New England Patriots head coach Bill Parcells to New York in 1997. Parcells led the team back to relevance and coached them to the AFC Championship Game in 1998. Hess died in 1999 while the team, plagued by injuries, produced an eight win record, falling short of a playoff berth. At the end of the season, Parcells stepped down as head coach deferring control to his assistant, Bill Belichick; Belichick resigned the very next day (leaving a napkin at the stage for his introduction, on which he had written \"I resign as HC of the NYJ\") and went on to accept the head coaching position with the Patriots.\nThe franchise obtained a new owner in Woody Johnson in 2000. Additionally, through the 2000s the Jets visited the playoffs five times, a franchise record, under the direction of three coaches. Rex Ryan was hired in January 2009. In the draft that year the Jets would take USC quarterback Mark Sanchez with the fifth overall pick with the intent of making him the franchise centerpiece. Ryan and Sanchez led the team to back-to-back AFC Championship Game appearances during their first two years, but the team never made the playoffs again during their tenure. After a 4\u201312 season in 2014, Sanchez was released, while Ryan and general manager John Idzik were fired.\nOwnership.\nHarry Wismer.\nHarry Wismer, a businessman, had been interested in sports for much of his life when he was granted a charter franchise in the American Football League. Wismer was a three-sport letterman in high school, and went on to play football for the University of Florida and Michigan State University before a knee injury ended his playing career. Undeterred, Wismer began his career as a broadcaster with Michigan State and became a pioneer of the industry. Later, as the Titans owner, Wismer formulated a league-wide policy which allowed broadcasting rights to be shared equally among the teams.\nWismer, who had previously had a 25% stake in the Washington Redskins, was interested in the American Football League and was given a franchise to develop in New York. Wismer, whose philosophy was who you knew mattered most, tried to make the team and the league a success. His efforts began to accrue debt as the Titans' first two seasons were mediocre with attendance dropping in the team's second year. The franchise was sold for $1\u00a0million to a five-man syndicate headed by Sonny Werblin of the Gotham Football Club, Inc., in February 1963.\nSonny Werblin syndicate.\nSonny Werblin graduated from Rutgers University and was employed by the Music Corporation of America, eventually becoming president of the company's television division. With a vast knowledge of media, Werblin was determined to put the spotlight on the team. His first order of business, after changing the team's name and jerseys, was to sign Joe Namath to an unprecedented contract. Werblin's gamble would later pay off as Namath, who became a public star, led the Jets on to victory in Super Bowl III, though by then Werblin had sold his stake in the team.\nWerblin's partners, Townsend B. Martin, Leon Hess, Donald C. Lillis, and Philip H. Iselin, had a falling out with Werblin over the way the team was run\u2014though the franchise had begun to make a profit, Werblin was making all the policies and decisions himself with little or no input from his partners, much to their dismay. Though Werblin initially resisted their ultimatum to dissolve the partnership, Werblin agreed to be bought out in 1968. Werblin remained involved in the sports community and became the first chairman and CEO of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority where he helped to create the Meadowlands Sports Complex, including Giants Stadium.\nLeon Hess.\nLeon Hess became well known for his Hess Corporation gas stations; however, he also played an instrumental part in the development of the Jets during his tenure as co-owner and eventual sole owner. Hess had often fought for improvements while the team was a tenant at Shea Stadium but generally stayed away from football operations, allowing his coaches and general manager to make football-related decisions.\nBecoming the team's majority stockholder in 1973, Hess bought Philip H. Iselin's share upon his death in 1976 after which only two of Hess' partners remained, Townsend Martin and Helen Dillon, who had inherited the stake from her father Donald Lillis, upon his death. Hess began to buy out the remaining partners in 1981 when he bought Martin's 25% stake for $5\u00a0million. Hess bought Dillon's stake three years later for another $5\u00a0million, acquiring sole control of the team.\nHess had a passion for his team and took losses hard. In 1995, following a mediocre 6\u201310 season under Pete Carroll, despite generally shying away from football operations, Hess announced \"I'm 80 years old, I want results now\" during a conference in which Rich Kotite was introduced as the team's new coach. After two unsuccessful years with Kotite, Hess heavily involved himself in hiring Bill Parcells in hopes to see his team again reach the Super Bowl. He did not live to see his dream realized, dying on May 7, 1999.\nWoody Johnson.\nWith the team for sale, two potential buyers were found in Cablevision and philanthropist Woody Johnson whose grandfather, Robert Wood Johnson II, expanded Johnson &amp; Johnson. Johnson was unknown among the other NFL owners at the time of his $635\u00a0million purchase of the franchise. However, Johnson had a passion for sports according to former Knicks general manager Ernie Grunfeld and desired to own his own team. Johnson has been considered to be an enabler who wants the best from his employees.\nMuch like Hess, Johnson left many of the football related decisions up to his management team and tended to avoid the spotlight. However, upon hiring head coach Rex Ryan, Johnson had an increased presence as he molded the Jets into his team.\nChristopher Johnson.\nIn 2017, Woody Johnson was appointed by President Donald Trump as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Once his post was confirmed, his brother Christopher Johnson became a co-owner and took over the day-to-day operations for the team, including personnel decisions. Woody Johnson's term as ambassador ended in 2021, and he took over ownership duties from Christopher.\nStadiums.\nOwner Harry Wismer sought out a place for the team to play their home games but was only able to secure the dilapidated Polo Grounds, which had not had a major tenant since the baseball New York Giants vacated the stadium in 1957. The Titans played their first four seasons at the stadium\u2014in the final season they were renamed the Jets. The Titans shared the stadium with baseball's new expansion team, the New York Mets, for two years before both teams moved to Shea Stadium in Queens in 1964. The Jets hold the distinction of being the final team to host a game at the Polo Grounds, a 19\u201310 loss to the Buffalo Bills on December 14, 1963.\nWismer hoped the Titans could play in what would become known as Shea Stadium beginning in 1961. However, funding difficulties and legal problems delayed construction of the stadium. Wismer signed a memorandum of understanding in late 1961 to secure the Titans' new home. That memorandum recognized that the Mets would have exclusive use of the stadium until they had completed their season. As the team moved to Shea under new ownership, they were, in most years, required to open the season with several road games, a problem made worse in 1969 and 1973 when the Mets had long playoff runs.\nFeeling that this arrangement put the Jets at a disadvantage, the team announced in 1977 that they would play two home games a year during the month of September at the Giants' new home in New Jersey, Giants Stadium. Litigation began between New York City and the Jets over the issue, and in the lawsuit's settlement, the city agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets' lease. In 1977, the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 2 game at Shea.\nIn spite of these issues, majority owner Leon Hess was interested in renewing the team's lease at Shea, which was due to expire in 1983. Hess negotiated with New York mayor Ed Koch. Hess wanted the city to redevelop the stadium to expand its capacity. He also hoped to renegotiate other aspects of the lease\u2014the Jets received no money from ticketholders parking at Shea. Hess's proposals met resistance from Koch. When negotiations reached an impasse, the Jets announced their intention to depart for New Jersey. On December 10, 1983, the Jets played their final game at Shea and lost to the Steelers 34\u20137. As fans pillaged the stadium for mementos, the scoreboard read \"N.J. Jets\" in reference to the Jets' departure to the Meadowlands.\nWhen the Jets joined the Giants at the stadium, many Jets fans hoped the name, Giants Stadium, would be changed. However, the Giants, who had the authority to approve the change, refused. In an effort to conceal the fact that they played in a stadium built and decorated for another team, the stadium grounds crew was assigned to make the stadium more Jet-friendly during Jets games by putting up green banners and placing the Jets' logo over the Giants'. No change could be made to the blue and red seating bowl. The Jets were featured in the first NFL playoff game in the stadium's history, falling to the Patriots on December 28, 1985.\nAs the Jets sought to become a stronger franchise and remove themselves from their counterparts' shadow, the team entered into negotiations with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in an attempt to build a stadium on the west side of Manhattan, entering a bidding war with TransGas Energy Systems and Cablevision for the rights to the West Side Yard property\u2014Hess, prior to his death, had been approached by former mayor Rudy Giuliani about bringing the team to the West Side when their lease at Giants Stadium expired in 2008. Cablevision was fixated against the Jets owning the land as Madison Square Garden, located only a few blocks away, would be forced to compete with the stadium. Team owners had voted, 31\u20131, with the Buffalo Bills the only objectors, to award the 2010 Super Bowl to New York contingent on the Jets winning the bid and completing construction of the stadium prior to 2010.\nThe MTA unanimously voted to sell the land to the Jets for approximately $210\u00a0million as the committee agreed that having the stadium would be beneficial in the long run. An angry Cablevision, community groups and transportation advocates were determined to derail the Jets' attempts at building the stadium and two lawsuits challenging the construction of the stadium on environmental grounds were filed.\nAlthough confident they could secure the stadium, their hopes were dashed when Sheldon Silver and Joseph L. Bruno, both of whom held veto power over the stadium construction, refused to support the project, alleging it would hurt rather than help the development of the West Side.\nDefeated, the Jets agreed to enter a 50\u201350 joint venture with their rival, the Giants, to build a new stadium effectively agreeing to a 99-year lease, which the Giants had signed earlier in the year, to remain in New Jersey. The stadium, known as MetLife Stadium, became the first in the history of the NFL to be jointly built by two franchises. The stadium, which is illuminated in different colors depending on which team is hosting a game, opened in April 2010 and saw the Jets and Giants open the stadium together in a preseason exhibition game. The Jets' first regular season home game at the new stadium was held on September 13, 2010 and was shown nationwide on Monday Night Football. New York lost to the Ravens 10\u20139. Team owners voted to have the stadium host Super Bowl XLVIII, held in 2014.\nRivalries.\nNew England Patriots.\nSince the inception of the American Football League, the Jets have maintained what is considered to be a marquee rivalry with the New England Patriots. The rivalry was relatively docile in its early years until 1966 when the Jets removed the Patriots, who had hopes of appearing in Super Bowl I, from playoff contention with a 38\u201328 defeat at Shea Stadium. The Patriots returned the favor in 1985 when the Jets lost to New England 26\u201314 in the wild card round; the Patriots went on to Super Bowl XX where they were defeated by the Bears.\nThe rivalry began to escalate and receive increased media attention in 1997 when a disgruntled Bill Parcells vacated his head coaching position with New England to accept the same position with New York Jets. The following year, the Jets signed Pro Bowl running back Curtis Martin from the Patriots. After the Jets declined during Parcells' third year, Parcells decided to resign as head coach. His assistant, Bill Belichick, was installed as the new head coach but suddenly resigned the next day at a press conference, just one day after accepting the position, to become the new head coach of the Patriots instead. His decision was influenced by the passing of the team owner, Leon Hess, before the '99 season, who at one point was offering Belichick a $1 million bonus to stay put. However, Belichick had not spoken to the two potential new owners, Woody Johnson and Charles Dolan, and had issues with both because the original agreement with Hess was no longer there; \"the whole ownership configuration at that point in time was a major factor in my decision much more than a personal relationship.\"\nA critical turning point of the rivalry took place on September 23, 2001 when Jets linebacker Mo Lewis tackled Drew Bledsoe, leaving the veteran with internal bleeding. This provided an opportunity for Tom Brady to take over as the starting quarterback and during his tenure, Brady successfully guided New England to six Super Bowl titles. In 2006, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, left New England to join the Jets as their head coach. Under Mangini, the famous Spygate incident took place, further escalating tensions between both clubs. When Rex Ryan was hired as the team's head coach, the rivalry further escalated due to an increased war of words between both teams. In January 2011, the two met in a Divisional Round playoff game. The visiting Jets pulled a 28\u201321 upset to advance to the AFC Championship Game, which they ultimately lost one week later to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nBuffalo Bills.\nThe Jets and the Bills represent the same state (New York), and this rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Western New York, where the Bills play. The teams are both charter members of the American Football League and have generally stayed in the same division since, even after the NFL and AFL merged. Aside from a few notable moments, such as O. J. Simpson breaking an NFL rushing record against the Jets, a playoff game in 1981, and ex-Jets coach Rex Ryan coaching the Bills for two years, the rivalry has otherwise been characterized by shared mediocrity and uncompetitive games, including notable blunders by quarterbacks Mark Sanchez of the Jets, and J. P. Losman of the Bills. However, in recent years, the series has heated up again due to a friendly rivalry between quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Josh Allen, who were selected in the first round of the 2018 draft.\nMiami Dolphins.\nNew York has maintained a rivalry with the Miami Dolphins since the Dolphins' inception in 1966. The Jets' best chance to reach the Super Bowl after the Super Bowl III victory was thwarted by A.J. Duhe in 1983 whose interception return for touchdown on a rain-soaked field in the conference championship game was the decisive score. One of the most famous games in Jets history took place in 1994 when the Dolphins ran the Fake Spike play, giving them an improbable victory and halting the Jets' momentum that season, serving as a precursor to the Jets' next two unsuccessful years under Rich Kotite. The Jets went on to complete an improbable victory of their own on October 23, 2000 in what is known as The Monday Night Miracle. The Jets, trailing the Dolphins 30\u20137 at the end of the third quarter, rallied in the fourth quarter scoring 23 unanswered points, eventually winning in overtime with a 40-yard John Hall kick.\nWhen Rex Ryan became New York's head coach, there was an increased war of words between the clubs culminating with Ryan flashing an obscene gesture to heckling Dolphins fans in January 2010. The rivalry continued between both teams when Sal Alosi, then the strength and conditioning coach of the Jets, tripped Dolphins cornerback Nolan Carroll. Carroll was not seriously injured and Alosi resigned nearly two months later.\nNew York Giants.\nThe New York Jets previously maintained a high tension rivalry against their in-town counterparts, the New York Giants, that has since diminished due to the infrequency with which the teams meet in the regular season. The pinnacle of the rivalry came on August 17, 1969 when both the Jets and Giants met for the first time, in a preseason game which was viewed as a \"turf war\" by both opponents. The Giants, considered a mediocre team at the time, were regarded as underdogs and were under much scrutiny by the media and their fans. Ultimately, the Jets bested their rival 37\u201314; this would result in the firing of Giants coach Allie Sherman.\nThe Jets met the Giants in 1988 during the final game of the regular season. The Jets, with a 7\u20137\u20131 record, had little to lose as their hopes for playoff contention had vanished. The Giants, however, were contending for a playoff spot (they were 10\u20135 at that point) and a victory would have secured their spot and their division title. Although the six point favorites, the Giants were unable to overcome the Jets defense which sacked Giants quarterback Phil Simms eight times. With the Jets' victory and victories by the Rams and Eagles, the Giants were eliminated from playoff contention and the Jets gained respect in the eyes of many.\nIn spite of the big sibling rivalry that has resulted in trash talk between the players, both teams have formed an unexpected and consequently strong partnership sharing Giants Stadium for 26 years and MetLife Stadium, a venture in which both teams own a 50% share of the stadium. The rivalry regained much of its tension in the 2011 NFL season when the Jets and Giants met in Week 16. Both teams needed a victory to keep their playoffs hope alive and there was significant trash talk between Rex Ryan and his players and many of the Giants in the weeks leading up to the game. Ryan and Giants running back Brandon Jacobs reportedly came close to blows after the game, a 29\u201314 win by the Giants. The two teams met again on December 6, 2015, with the Jets coming from behind and winning 23\u201320 in overtime. To further boost it up, the Giants and Jets met again in 2019, with the Jets having the lead, Giants taking it, and the Jets retaking it to win 34\u201327.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe Jets redesigned their uniforms and primary logo for the 2019 season. The new team colors are a medium green that the franchise calls \"Gotham Green,\" white, and black. The primary logo is a green football-shaped oval outlined in white, oriented horizontally, with the word \"JETS\" in thick, sans-serif italics positioned just below the horizontal axis with \"NEW YORK\" above it in smaller letters, and a miniature football graphic at bottom center partially covering the lower portion of the \"E\" and \"T\".\nThe primary uniform consists of green jerseys with white numerals and white jerseys with green numerals, green and white pants, and green socks. The numerals are in a new sans-serif block-style font and have thin black outlines, with \"NEW YORK\" in thick sans-serif italics above the numerals on the front, TV numerals on the upper shoulders, and the player's name in sans-serif block letters on the back, in either green or white. The jerseys have opposite-colored stripes around the shoulder that taper toward the collar, and the pants have opposite-colored stripes on each side that taper toward the lower thigh. The team also has a black alternate uniform with white numerals outlined in green, green stripes and black socks.\nThe helmet is a deep metallic emerald green with a black facemask; the decal on each side is a secondary logo, consisting of the primary logo's \"JETS\" wordmark and football graphic.\nThe team's original uniforms, as the Titans of New York in 1960, were navy blue with old gold numerals, gold pants with two parallel blue stripes on each side, and navy blue helmets with a single gold stripe down the center and no logo decals. The white jerseys had navy blue numerals. In 1961, the Titans added UCLA-style shoulder stripes (gold and white on the blue jerseys, gold and navy blue on the white jerseys), changed the pants striping to a blue stripe flanked by white stripes, and employed a somewhat brighter shade of gold.\nWhen the Titans became the Jets in 1963, navy and gold were abandoned in favor of kelly green and white. The jerseys had opposite-colored sleeves with thick stripes on the shoulders and cuffs, above and below the TV numerals. The pants were white with two parallel green stripes on each side. The new helmets were white with a single green stripe down the center; the logo on each side was a silhouette of a jet airplane in green, with the word \"JETS\" in thick white sans-serif italics along the fuselage. In 1964, the single green stripe became two parallel stripes, and the jet-plane decal was replaced with a white football shape outlined in green, with the word \"JETS\" in thick green sans-serif italics in front of \"NY\" in green outline serif lettering, and a miniature football at bottom center. The decals were difficult to see from a distance (or on television), so the colors were reversed in 1965.\nThis design remained largely unchanged through 1977, apart from some variations to the numeral and lettering typefaces, the angle of the helmet decals, and adjustments to the shoulder and sleeve striping due to changes in NFL jersey tailoring and materials.\nThe Jets' first major design change was made for the 1978 season. The kelly green and white color scheme was retained; the new helmets were solid green with white facemasks, and a stylized \"JETS\" wordmark in white on each side. The mark featured angular lettering and a silhouette of a modern jet airplane extending horizontally to the right from the top of the \"J\" above the \"ETS\". The jerseys featured large TV numerals on the shoulders and two thick parallel stripes on the sleeves, while the pants had a single green stripe from hip to knee on each side. In 1990, the Jets modified this design by adding thin black outlines to the numerals, lettering, stripes and helmet decals, changing the facemasks from white to black, and adding a set of green pants to be worn with the white jerseys.\nThe Jets were the first NFL team to wear a \"throwback\" uniform, in 1993 for a home game against the Cincinnati Bengals celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 1968 championship team. The jersey and pants mimicked the 1963\u201377 design, although the team wore its regular green helmets with a white-outlined version of the 1965\u201377 logo decal. In 1994, as part of the NFL's 75th Anniversary celebration, the Jets wore both home and road versions of this uniform in select games, again using their regular green helmets with the 1965\u201377 logo but with two parallel white stripes down the center.\nThe Jets adopted a new uniform and logo design in 1998, a modernization of the 1960s\u20131970s set. Green pants were added in 2002, and have been worn with both the white and green jerseys.\nIn 2007, the team introduced a new \"throwback\" uniform, evoking the original Titans of New York and combining elements of the 1960 and 1961\u201362 uniforms, with navy blue helmets and jerseys, old gold numerals and helmet stripes, gold and white shoulder stripes, and gold pants with blue and white stripes on each side. These uniforms appeared again in 2008, 2009 and 2011, with a white jersey variation also appearing in 2009 as part of the NFL's celebration of the American Football League's 50th anniversary.\nThe Jets unveiled new jerseys and an updated logo for the 2019 season. The jerseys are colored \"Gotham Green\" for home and \"Spotlight White\" for away. They also reintroduced black as a team color for the first time since 1997.\nCheerleading squad.\nThe original Jets Flag Crew was established in 2006. In 2007, the group underwent an expansion and was renamed the Jets Flight Crew. The squad regularly performs choreographed routines during the team's home contests. Auditions have been held annually since their inception to attract new members.\nThe Jets Junior Flight Crew was established in 2010, offering children the opportunity to train with the Flight Crew while improving their \"talent and abilities in a non-competitive environment.\"\nRadio and television.\nThe Jets' current flagship radio station is WEPN 98.7 ESPN with Bob Wischusen as the play-by-play announcer and former Jet Marty Lyons, of the Sack Exchange, as the color analyst.\nAny preseason games not nationally televised are shown on WCBS-TV. SportsNet New York, which serves as the official home of the Jets, airs over 250 hours of \"exclusive, in depth\" material on the team in high definition.\nMonday Night Football games are televised in a simulcast with ESPN by either sister station WABC-TV, or WPIX-TV if WABC chooses to waive the game to another station to carry regularly scheduled programming. Thursday Night Football carriage of a Jets game is incumbent on the producing network for that game (on FOX), which is also simulcast by NFL Network.\nSeason-by-season record.\nThis is a partial list of the Jets' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of New York Jets seasons.\n\"Note: The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play.\"\nPlayers.\nPro Football Hall of Famers.\nEwbank, Hill, Martin, Mawae, Maynard, and Namath are recognized based upon their achievements with the Jets. Ewbank is also recognized based upon his achievements with the Baltimore Colts, coaching them to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959. Riggins is recognized primarily for his seasons with the Washington Redskins (1976\u20131979, 1981\u20131985), as is Monk (1980\u20131993), who won three Super Bowl championships with Washington. Lott is in the Hall of Fame primarily for his exploits as a member of the San Francisco 49ers. Baugh and Turner are recognized based upon their achievements as players with other teams, rather than their head coaching stints with the Jets. While Parcells reversed the fortunes of the Jets, he had major impact for the New York Giants, coaching them to two Super Bowl victories. Wolf only had a brief stint with the Jets between 1990 and 1991, while most of his major contributions occurred as an executive and player personnel director with the Oakland Raiders (1963\u20131974, 1979\u20131989), and later as General Manager of the Green Bay Packers (1991\u20132001). Favre only played one season as a member of the Jets in 2008, between most of his career with the Packers (1992\u20132007) and his last two NFL seasons with the Minnesota Vikings (2009\u20132010).\nRetired numbers.\nAdditionally, the Jets have not reissued the #80 jersey of Wayne Chrebet (WR, 1995\u20132005) since he suffered a career-ending concussion in the 2005 season, and it has long been understood that it will not be worn again in the foreseeable future. Along similar lines, Byrd's #90 had not been reissued since he suffered a career-ending neck injury in 1992, and it had been understood long before his number was formally retired that no Jet would ever wear it again. Further, the Jets have not reissued #24 since the release of Darrelle Revis in 2016.\nRing of Honor.\nThe Jets established a Ring of Honor on July 20, 2010, to commemorate former players. Each season, players will be nominated by an internal committee and then inducted into the Ring. There is no specific amount of honorees to be selected each year.\nAmerican Football League All-Time Team.\nThe following Titans/Jets were selected to the American Football League All-Time Team on January 14, 1970. The first and second teams were determined by a panel of members of the AFL's Hall of Fame Board of Selectors: Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nAll-Time Four Decade Team.\nNew York announced their official All-Time Four Decade team in 2003, which was determined by the fans of the team. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nNotable first-round draft picks.\nPerhaps the most famous of the Jets' first round picks came in 1965 when they selected Alabama quarterback Joe Namath who boosted the Jets into the national spotlight with his boisterous personality and lifestyle. His physical talents on the field helped improve the Jets' fortunes, leading them to victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Though injuries hampered the latter part of Namath's career, he is best remembered, according to former teammate John Dockery, as \"a guy that came along and broke a lot of the conventions.\" Namath was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1985.\nThe Jets have had a history of selecting players who turned out to be draft busts. Perhaps one of the most disappointing players in Jets history was running back Blair Thomas. Thomas, who averaged 5.4 yards per carry at Penn State, was an intriguing prospect the Jets were interested in utilizing to help their cumbersome offense. Confident in their decision, the Jets drafted Thomas with the second overall pick in 1990, expecting him to be a solid player for years to come. Thomas ran for only 620\u00a0yards in 1990, and failed to meet the high expectations. By the time Thomas left the team as an unrestricted free agent in 1993, he had rushed for 2,009 yards and only five touchdowns. The 2008 first round pick, defensive lineman Vernon Gholston, followed a similar path, failing to record a sack during his three-year tenure with the team.\nKyle Brady in 1995, who was drafted ahead of Warren Sapp, one of many disappointments during Rich Kotite's tenure as coach. However, in the same draft, the Jets did better with Hugh Douglas. Dewayne Robertson was a fourth overall selection in 2003 by the Jets. The defensive tackle out of Kentucky failed to make a big impact with the team. He accounted for 14.5 sacks in his 5 seasons with the team, a rather underwhelming player given what the Jets had hoped for. At quarterback, the Jets found themselves dealing with the consequences of drafting University of Alabama QB Richard Todd in 1976. In his tenure with the Jets, he threw for more interceptions than he did touchdowns. In the '81 season, the Jets played vs the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Championship Game. Todd threw for 5 interceptions and the Jets lost the game. A year later, Todd would be traded to the New Orleans Saints. The most recent bust, Dee Milliner, was drafted by the team in 2013. Milliner played his college career at the University of Alabama and had high expectations after being drafted. Lasting just 3 years with the team, Milliner's career was plagued by injuries and inconsistency, recording only 3 interceptions during his brief Jets career.\nIn the 2013 and 2014 seasons, one of the Jets' strongest units was their defensive line, manned by 1st Round selections Muhammad Wilkerson (2011) and Sheldon Richardson (2013). In 2013, Wilkerson ended the season with 10.5 sacks, matching the last Jets player to have more than 10 sacks in a single season, John Abraham in 2005. Also that year, Richardson was honored with an award from the AP for Defensive Rookie of the Year. The Jets' run defense was stout with all three in the line up, finishing fifth as a team in rushing yards allowed in 2014.\nIn the 2017 NFL Draft, the Jets selected Jamal Adams with the sixth overall pick out of LSU. Adams had a strong start to his early career, making the Pro Bowl in the 2018 season and winning the Defensive MVP Award alongside Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback Patrick Mahomes as the Offensive MVP.\nIn the 2019 NFL Draft, the Jets selected Quinnen Williams from Alabama with the third overall pick. Williams had been touted as the best overall prospect leading up to the draft, being compared to defensive tackle superstar Aaron Donald. Williams ended up being the final first-round pick by then general manager Mike Maccagnan, who was fired shortly after the draft. Williams struggled in his rookie year with injuries and inconsistent play, but showed promise as a defensive anchor in his 2020 season: he recorded 7.0 sacks and 55 total tackles before being added to the Injured Reserved list in the final weeks of the season.\nIn the 2020 NFL Draft, the Jets selected offensive tackle Mekhi Becton from Louisville with the eleventh overall pick."}
{"id": "21723", "revid": "4513618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21723", "title": "Nonlinear optics", "text": "Nonlinear optics (NLO) is the branch of optics that describes the behaviour of light in \"nonlinear media\", that is, media in which the polarization density P responds non-linearly to the electric field E of the light. The non-linearity is typically observed only at very high light intensities (when the electric field of the light is &gt;108 V/m and thus comparable to the atomic electric field of ~1011 V/m) such as those provided by lasers. Above the Schwinger limit, the vacuum itself is expected to become nonlinear. In nonlinear optics, the superposition principle no longer holds.\nHistory.\nThe first nonlinear optical effect to be predicted was two-photon absorption, by Maria Goeppert Mayer for her PhD in 1931, but it remained an unexplored theoretical curiosity until 1961 and the almost simultaneous observation of two-photon absorption at Bell Labs\nand the discovery of second-harmonic generation by Peter Franken \"et al.\" at University of Michigan, both shortly after the construction of the first laser by Theodore Maiman. However, some nonlinear effects were discovered before the development of the laser. The theoretical basis for many nonlinear processes were first described in Bloembergen's monograph \"Nonlinear Optics\".\nNonlinear optical processes.\nNonlinear optics explains nonlinear response of properties such as frequency, polarization, phase or path of incident light. These nonlinear interactions give rise to a host of optical phenomena:\nRelated processes.\nIn these processes, the medium has a linear response to the light, but the properties of the medium are affected by other causes:\nParametric processes.\nNonlinear effects fall into two qualitatively different categories, parametric and non-parametric effects. A parametric non-linearity\nis an interaction in which the quantum state of the nonlinear material is not changed by the interaction with the optical field. As a consequence of this, the process is \"instantaneous\". Energy and momentum are conserved in the optical field, making phase matching important and polarization-dependent.\nTheory.\nParametric and \"instantaneous\" (i.e. material must be lossless and dispersionless through the Kramers\u2013Kronig relations) nonlinear optical phenomena, in which the optical fields are not too large, can be described by a Taylor series expansion of the dielectric polarization density (electric dipole moment per unit volume) P(\"t\") at time \"t\" in terms of the electric field E(\"t\"):\nwhere the coefficients \u03c7(\"n\") are the \"n\"-th-order susceptibilities of the medium, and the presence of such a term is generally referred to as an \"n\"-th-order nonlinearity. Note that the polarization density P(\"t\") and electrical field E(\"t\") are considered as scalar for simplicity. In general, \u03c7(\"n\") is an (\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)-th-rank tensor representing both the polarization-dependent nature of the parametric interaction and the symmetries (or lack) of the nonlinear material.\nWave equation in a nonlinear material.\nCentral to the study of electromagnetic waves is the wave equation. Starting with Maxwell's equations in an isotropic space, containing no free charge, it can be shown that\nwhere PNL is the nonlinear part of the polarization density, and \"n\" is the refractive index, which comes from the linear term in P.\nNote that one can normally use the vector identity\nand Gauss's law (assuming no free charges, formula_6),\nto obtain the more familiar wave equation\nFor a nonlinear medium, Gauss's law does not imply that the identity\nis true in general, even for an isotropic medium. However, even when this term is not identically 0, it is often negligibly small and thus in practice is usually ignored, giving us the standard nonlinear wave equation:\nNonlinearities as a wave-mixing process.\nThe nonlinear wave equation is an inhomogeneous differential equation. The general solution comes from the study of ordinary differential equations and can be obtained by the use of a Green's function. Physically one gets the normal electromagnetic wave solutions to the homogeneous part of the wave equation:\nand the inhomogeneous term\nacts as a driver/source of the electromagnetic waves. One of the consequences of this is a nonlinear interaction that results in energy being mixed or coupled between different frequencies, which is often called a \"wave mixing\".\nIn general, an \"n\"-th order nonlinearity will lead to (\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)-wave mixing. As an example, if we consider only a second-order nonlinearity (three-wave mixing), then the polarization P takes the form\nIf we assume that \"E\"(\"t\") is made up of two components at frequencies \"\u03c9\"1 and \"\u03c9\"2, we can write \"E\"(\"t\") as\nand using Euler's formula to convert to exponentials,\nwhere \"c.c.\" stands for complex conjugate. Plugging this into the expression for P gives\nwhich has frequency components at 2\"\u03c9\"1, 2\"\u03c9\"2, \"\u03c9\"1\u00a0+\u00a0\"\u03c9\"2, \"\u03c9\"1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"\u03c9\"2, and 0. These three-wave mixing processes correspond to the nonlinear effects known as second-harmonic generation, sum-frequency generation, difference-frequency generation and optical rectification respectively.\nNote: Parametric generation and amplification is a variation of difference-frequency generation, where the lower frequency of one of the two generating fields is much weaker (parametric amplification) or completely absent (parametric generation). In the latter case, the fundamental quantum-mechanical uncertainty in the electric field initiates the process.\nPhase matching.\nThe above ignores the position dependence of the electrical fields. In a typical situation, the electrical fields are traveling waves described by\nat position formula_18, with the wave vector formula_19, where formula_20 is the velocity of light in vacuum, and formula_21 is the index of refraction of the medium at angular frequency formula_22. Thus, the second-order polarization at angular frequency formula_23 is\nAt each position formula_18 within the nonlinear medium, the oscillating second-order polarization radiates at angular frequency formula_26 and a corresponding wave vector formula_27. Constructive interference, and therefore a high-intensity formula_26 field, will occur only if\nThe above equation is known as the \"phase-matching condition\". Typically, three-wave mixing is done in a birefringent crystalline material, where the refractive index depends on the polarization and direction of the light that passes through. The polarizations of the fields and the orientation of the crystal are chosen such that the phase-matching condition is fulfilled. This phase-matching technique is called angle tuning. Typically a crystal has three axes, one or two of which have a different refractive index than the other one(s). Uniaxial crystals, for example, have a single preferred axis, called the extraordinary (e) axis, while the other two are ordinary axes (o) (see crystal optics). There are several schemes of choosing the polarizations for this crystal type. If the signal and idler have the same polarization, it is called \"type-I phase matching\", and if their polarizations are perpendicular, it is called \"type-II phase matching\". However, other conventions exist that specify further which frequency has what polarization relative to the crystal axis. These types are listed below, with the convention that the signal wavelength is shorter than the idler wavelength.\nMost common nonlinear crystals are negative uniaxial, which means that the \"e\" axis has a smaller refractive index than the \"o\" axes. In those crystals, type-I and -II phase matching are usually the most suitable schemes. In positive uniaxial crystals, types VII and VIII are more suitable. Types II and III are essentially equivalent, except that the names of signal and idler are swapped when the signal has a longer wavelength than the idler. For this reason, they are sometimes called IIA and IIB. The type numbers V\u2013VIII are less common than I and II and variants.\nOne undesirable effect of angle tuning is that the optical frequencies involved do not propagate collinearly with each other. This is due to the fact that the extraordinary wave propagating through a birefringent crystal possesses a Poynting vector that is not parallel to the propagation vector. This would lead to beam walk-off, which limits the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency. Two other methods of phase matching avoid beam walk-off by forcing all frequencies to propagate at a 90\u00b0 with respect to the optical axis of the crystal. These methods are called temperature tuning and quasi-phase-matching.\nTemperature tuning is used when the pump (laser) frequency polarization is orthogonal to the signal and idler frequency polarization. The birefringence in some crystals, in particular lithium niobate is highly temperature-dependent. The crystal temperature is controlled to achieve phase-matching conditions.\nThe other method is quasi-phase-matching. In this method the frequencies involved are not constantly locked in phase with each other, instead the crystal axis is flipped at a regular interval \u039b, typically 15 micrometres in length. Hence, these crystals are called periodically poled. This results in the polarization response of the crystal to be shifted back in phase with the pump beam by reversing the nonlinear susceptibility. This allows net positive energy flow from the pump into the signal and idler frequencies. In this case, the crystal itself provides the additional wavevector \"k\"\u00a0=\u00a02\u03c0/\u039b (and hence momentum) to satisfy the phase-matching condition. Quasi-phase-matching can be expanded to chirped gratings to get more bandwidth and to shape an SHG pulse like it is done in a dazzler. SHG of a pump and self-phase modulation (emulated by second-order processes) of the signal and an optical parametric amplifier can be integrated monolithically.\nHigher-order frequency mixing.\nThe above holds for formula_30 processes. It can be extended for processes where formula_1 is nonzero, something that is generally true in any medium without any symmetry restrictions; in particular resonantly enhanced sum or difference frequency mixing in gasses is frequently used for extreme or \"vacuum\" ultra-violet light generation. In common scenarios, such as mixing in dilute gases, the non-linearity is weak and so the light beams are focused which, unlike the plane wave approximation used above, introduces a pi phase shift on each light beam, complicating the phase-matching requirements. Conveniently, difference frequency mixing with formula_1 cancels this focal phase shift and often has a nearly self-canceling overall phase-matching condition, which relatively simplifies broad wavelength tuning compared to sum frequency generation. In formula_1 all four frequencies are mixing simultaneously, as opposed to sequential mixing via two formula_30 processes.\nThe Kerr effect can be described as a formula_1 as well. At high peak powers the Kerr effect can cause filamentation of light in air, in which the light travels without dispersion or divergence in a self-generated waveguide. At even high intensities the Taylor series, which led the domination of the lower orders, does not converge anymore and instead a time based model is used. When a noble gas atom is hit by an intense laser pulse, which has an electric field strength comparable to the Coulomb field of the atom, the outermost electron may be ionized from the atom. Once freed, the electron can be accelerated by the electric field of the light, first moving away from the ion, then back toward it as the field changes direction. The electron may then recombine with the ion, releasing its energy in the form of a photon. The light is emitted at every peak of the laser light field which is intense enough, producing a series of attosecond light flashes. The photon energies generated by this process can extend past the 800th harmonic order up to a few KeV. This is called high-order harmonic generation. The laser must be linearly polarized, so that the electron returns to the vicinity of the parent ion. High-order harmonic generation has been observed in noble gas jets, cells, and gas-filled capillary waveguides.\nExample uses.\nFrequency doubling.\nOne of the most commonly used frequency-mixing processes is frequency doubling, or second-harmonic generation. With this technique, the 1064\u00a0nm output from Nd:YAG lasers or the 800\u00a0nm output from Ti:sapphire lasers can be converted to visible light, with wavelengths of 532\u00a0nm (green) or 400\u00a0nm (violet) respectively.\nPractically, frequency doubling is carried out by placing a nonlinear medium in a laser beam. While there are many types of nonlinear media, the most common media are crystals. Commonly used crystals are BBO (\u03b2-barium borate), KDP (potassium dihydrogen phosphate), KTP (potassium titanyl phosphate), and lithium niobate. These crystals have the necessary properties of being strongly birefringent (necessary to obtain phase matching, see below), having a specific crystal symmetry, being transparent for both the impinging laser light and the frequency-doubled wavelength, and having high damage thresholds, which makes them resistant against the high-intensity laser light.\nOptical phase conjugation.\nIt is possible, using nonlinear optical processes, to exactly reverse the propagation direction and phase variation of a beam of light. The reversed beam is called a \"conjugate\" beam, and thus the technique is known as optical phase conjugation (also called \"time reversal\", \"wavefront reversal\" and is significantly different from \"retroreflection\").\nA device producing the phase-conjugation effect is known as a phase-conjugate mirror (PCM).\nPrinciples.\nOne can interpret optical phase conjugation as being analogous to a real-time holographic process. In this case, the interacting beams simultaneously interact in a nonlinear optical material to form a dynamic hologram (two of the three input beams), or real-time diffraction pattern, in the material. The third incident beam diffracts at this dynamic hologram, and, in the process, reads out the \"phase-conjugate\" wave. In effect, all three incident beams interact (essentially) simultaneously to form several real-time holograms, resulting in a set of diffracted output waves that phase up as the \"time-reversed\" beam. In the language of nonlinear optics, the interacting beams result in a nonlinear polarization within the material, which coherently radiates to form the phase-conjugate wave.\nReversal of wavefront means a perfect reversal of photons' linear momentum and angular momentum. The reversal of angular momentum means reversal of both polarization state and orbital angular momentum. Reversal of orbital angular momentum of optical vortex is due to the perfect match of helical phase profiles of the incident and reflected beams. Optical phase conjugation is implemented via stimulated Brillouin scattering, four-wave mixing, three-wave mixing, static linear holograms and some other tools.\nThe most common way of producing optical phase conjugation is to use a four-wave mixing technique, though it is also possible to use processes such as stimulated Brillouin scattering.\nFour-wave mixing technique.\nFor the four-wave mixing technique, we can describe four beams (\"j\" = 1, 2, 3, 4) with electric fields:\nwhere \"Ej\" are the electric field amplitudes. \u039e1 and \u039e2 are known as the two pump waves, with \u039e3 being the signal wave, and \u039e4 being the generated conjugate wave.\nIf the pump waves and the signal wave are superimposed in a medium with a non-zero \u03c7(3), this produces a nonlinear polarization field:\nresulting in generation of waves with frequencies given by \u03c9 = \u00b1\u03c91 \u00b1 \u03c92 \u00b1 \u03c93 in addition to third-harmonic generation waves with \u03c9 = 3\u03c91, 3\u03c92, 3\u03c93.\nAs above, the phase-matching condition determines which of these waves is the dominant. By choosing conditions such that \u03c9 = \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c93 and k = k1 + k2 \u2212 k3, this gives a polarization field:\nThis is the generating field for the phase-conjugate beam, \u039e4. Its direction is given by k4 = k1 + k2 \u2212 k3, and so if the two pump beams are counterpropagating (k1 = \u2212k2), then the conjugate and signal beams propagate in opposite directions (k4 = \u2212k3). This results in the retroreflecting property of the effect.\nFurther, it can be shown that for a medium with refractive index \"n\" and a beam interaction length \"l\", the electric field amplitude of the conjugate beam is approximated by\nwhere \"c\" is the speed of light. If the pump beams \"E\"1 and \"E\"2 are plane (counterpropagating) waves, then\nthat is, the generated beam amplitude is the complex conjugate of the signal beam amplitude. Since the imaginary part of the amplitude contains the phase of the beam, this results in the reversal of phase property of the effect.\nNote that the constant of proportionality between the signal and conjugate beams can be greater than 1. This is effectively a mirror with a reflection coefficient greater than 100%, producing an amplified reflection. The power for this comes from the two pump beams, which are depleted by the process.\nThe frequency of the conjugate wave can be different from that of the signal wave. If the pump waves are of frequency \u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c9, and the signal wave is higher in frequency such that \u03c93 = \u03c9 + \u0394\u03c9, then the conjugate wave is of frequency \u03c94 = \u03c9\u00a0\u2212 \u0394\u03c9. This is known as \"frequency flipping\".\nAngular and linear momenta in optical phase conjugation.\nClassical picture.\nIn \"classical Maxwell electrodynamics\" a phase-conjugating mirror performs reversal of the Poynting vector:\n(\"in\" means incident field, \"out\" means reflected field) where\nwhich is a linear momentum density of electromagnetic field.\nIn the same way a phase-conjugated wave has an opposite angular momentum density vector formula_43 \nwith respect to incident field:\nThe above identities are valid \"locally\", i.e. in each space point formula_45 in a given moment formula_46 for an \"ideal phase-conjugating mirror\".\nQuantum picture.\nIn \"quantum electrodynamics\" the photon with energy formula_47 also possesses linear momentum formula_48 and angular momentum, whose projection on propagation axis is formula_49, where formula_50 is \"topological charge\" of photon, or winding number, formula_51 is propagation axis. The angular momentum projection on propagation axis has \"discrete values\" formula_52.\nIn \"quantum electrodynamics\" the interpretation of phase conjugation is much simpler compared to \"classical electrodynamics\". The photon reflected from phase conjugating-mirror (out) has opposite directions of linear and angular momenta with respect to incident photon (in):\nNonlinear optical pattern formation.\nOptical fields transmitted through nonlinear Kerr media can also display pattern formation owing to the nonlinear medium amplifying spatial and temporal noise. The effect is referred to as optical modulation instability. This has been observed both in photo-refractive, photonic lattices, as well as photo-reactive systems. In the latter case, optical nonlinearity is afforded by reaction-induced increases in refractive index. Examples of pattern formation are spatial solitons and vortex lattices in framework of nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nMolecular nonlinear optics.\nThe early studies of nonlinear optics and materials focused on the inorganic solids. With the development of nonlinear optics, molecular optical properties were investigated, forming molecular nonlinear optics. The traditional approaches used in the past to enhance nonlinearities include extending chromophore \u03c0-systems, adjusting bond length alternation, inducing intramolecular charge transfer, extending conjugation in 2D, and engineering multipolar charge distributions. Recently, many novel directions were proposed for enhanced nonlinearity and light manipulation, including twisted chromophores, combining rich density of states with bond alternation, microscopic cascading of second-order nonlinearity, etc. Due to the distinguished advantages, molecular nonlinear optics have been widely used in the biophotonics field, including bioimaging, phototherapy, biosensing, etc.\nCommon second-harmonic-generating (SHG) materials.\nOrdered by pump wavelength:"}
{"id": "21724", "revid": "1108604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21724", "title": "Normandy", "text": "Normandy (; ; ; from Old French , plural of \"Normant\", originally from the word for \"northman\" in several Scandinavian languages) is a geographical and cultural region in Northwestern Europe, roughly coextensive with the historical Duchy of Normandy.\nNormandy comprises mainland Normandy (a part of France) and the Channel Islands (mostly the British Crown Dependencies). It covers . Its population is 3,499,280. The inhabitants of Normandy are known as Normans, and the region is the historic homeland of the Norman language. Large settlements include Rouen, Caen, Le Havre and Cherbourg.\nThe cultural region of Normandy is roughly similar to the historical Duchy of Normandy, which includes small areas now part of the departments of Mayenne and Sarthe. The Channel Islands (French: \"\u00celes Anglo-Normandes\") are also historically part of Normandy; they cover and comprise two bailiwicks: Guernsey and Jersey, which are British Crown Dependencies.\nNormandy's name comes from the settlement of the territory by Vikings (\"Northmen\") starting in the 9th century, and confirmed by treaty in the 10th century between King Charles III of France and the Viking \"jarl\" Rollo. For almost 150 years following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, Normandy and England were linked by having the same person reign as both Duke of Normandy and King of England.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nArchaeological finds, such as cave paintings, prove that humans were present in the region in prehistoric times. Normandy has also many megalithic monuments.\nCeltic period.\nCelts (also known as Belgae and Gauls) have populated Normandy since at least the Bronze Age. When Julius Caesar invaded Gaul (58\u201350 BC), there were nine different Celtic tribes living in this part of Gaul.\nRomanisation.\nThe Romanisation of this region partly included in the \"Gallia Celtica\" and in the \"Gallia Belgica\" (the Seine being more or less the limit between them) was achieved by the usual methods: Roman roads and a policy of urbanisation. Classicists mention many Gallo-Roman villas and archeology found their traces in the past 30 years. In the Late Roman Empire a new province was created and called \"Lugdunensis Secunda\", it sketched the later ecclesiastical province of Rouen, with the \"Metropolis civitas Rotomagensium\"\n(Rouen), \"Civitas Baiocassium\" (\"Augustodorum\", Bayeux), \"Civitas Abrincatum\" (\"Ingena\", Avranches), \"Civitas Ebroicorum\" (\"Mediolanum\", \u00c9vreux), \"Civitas Saiorum\" (S\u00e9es), \"Civitas Lexoviorum\" (\"Noviomagus\", Lisieux / Lieuvin) and \"Civitas Constantia\" (Coutances).\nGermanic invasions and settlements.\nIn the late 3rd century AD, Germanic raids devastated \u2033Lugdunensis Secunda\u2033 as the modern area of Normandy was known as at the time. The Romans built a system of coastal defences known as Saxon Shore on both sides of the English channel. Coastal settlements were raided by Saxon pirates, that finally settled mainly in the Bessin region. Modern archeology reveals their presence in different Merovingian cemeteries excavated east of Caen. Christianity also began to enter the area during this period and Rouen already had a metropolitan bishop by the 4th century. The ecclesiastical province of Rouen was based on the frame of the Roman \"Lugdunensis Secunda\", whose limits corresponded almost exactly to the future duchy of Normandy. In 406, Germanic tribes began invading from the east, followed by dispersed settlements mainly in pays de Bray, pays de Caux and Vexin. As early as 487, the area between the River Somme and the River Loire came under the control of the Frankish lord Clovis.\nViking raids and foundation of the Norman state.\nVikings started to raid along the river Seine during the middle of the 9th century. As early as 841, a Viking fleet appeared at the mouth of the Seine, the principal route by which they entered the kingdom. After attacking and destroying monasteries, including one at Jumi\u00e8ges, they took advantage of the power vacuum created by the disintegration of Charlemagne's empire to take northern France. The fiefdom of Normandy was created for the Viking leader \"Hr\u00f3lfr\", known in Medieval Latin as \"Rollo\". Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered vassalage to the king of the West Franks, Charles the Simple, through the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. In exchange for his homage and fealty, Rollo legally gained the territory that he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name \"Normandy\" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. \"Norseman\") origins.\nThe descendants of \"Rollo\" and his followers created an aristocracy that step by step adopted the local Gallo-Romance language, intermarried with the area's native Gallo-Frankish inhabitants, and adopted Christianity. Nevertheless, the first generations of Scandinavian and Anglo-Scandinavian settlers brought slaves, mainly from the British Isles, and often turned the women into \"frilla\", a Scandinavian tradition which became known as \"more Danico\", medieval Latin meaning \"Danish marriage\". The first counts of Rouen and the dukes of Normandy had concubines too. While very little archeological excavations about the Vikings were done in Normandy, the Norman toponymy retains a large Scandinavian and Anglo-Scandinavian heritage, due to a constant use of Old Norse during four or five generations in certain parts of Normandy.\nThey then became the Normans \u2013 a Norman French-speaking mixture of Norsemen and indigenous Gallo-Franks.\nRollo's descendant William became king of England in 1066 after defeating Harold Godwinson, the last of the Anglo-Saxon kings, at the Battle of Hastings, while retaining the fiefdom of Normandy for himself and his descendants.\nNorman expansion.\nAside from the conquest of England and the subsequent invasions of Wales and Ireland, the Normans expanded into other areas. Norman families, such as that of Tancred of Hauteville, Rainulf Drengot and Guimond de Moulins played important parts in the conquest of southern Italy and the Crusades.\nThe Drengot lineage, de Hauteville's sons William Iron Arm, Drogo, and Humphrey, Robert Guiscard and Roger the Great Count progressively claimed territories in southern Italy until founding the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. They also carved out a place for themselves and their descendants in the Crusader states of Asia Minor and the Holy Land.\nThe 14th-century explorer Jean de B\u00e9thencourt established a kingdom in the Canary Islands in 1404. He received the title King of the Canary Islands from Pope Innocent VII but recognized Henry III of Castile as his overlord, who had provided him with military and financial aid during the conquest.\n13th to 17th centuries.\nIn 1204, during the reign of John of England, mainland Normandy was taken from the English kingdom by the King of France Philip II, that ended with this conquest some 293 years of relative Norman independence from the French crown. Insular Normandy (the Channel Islands) remained, however, under control of the king of England and still attached to the ecclesiastical province of Rouen. In 1259, Henry III of England recognized the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the Treaty of Paris. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of their ancient fiefdom.\nThe \"Charte aux Normands\" granted by Louis X of France in 1315 (and later re-confirmed in 1339) \u2013 like the analogous Magna Carta granted in England in the aftermath of 1204 \u2013 guaranteed the liberties and privileges of the province of Normandy.\nFrench Normandy was devastated by the civil wars and conflicts against the English power during the Hundred Years' War. Between 1419 and 1450 strong English forces occupied Normandy, except the Mont-Saint-Michel, and made of Rouen, the seat of their power in France. It explains why Joan of Arc was burnt in Rouen, but not in Paris. Normandy lost three-quarters of its population during the war. Afterwards, prosperity returned to Normandy until the Wars of Religion. When many Norman towns (Alen\u00e7on, Rouen, Caen, Coutances, Bayeux) joined the Protestant Reformation, battles ensued throughout the province. In the Channel Islands, a period of Calvinism following the Reformation was suppressed when Anglicanism was imposed following the English Civil War.\nSamuel de Champlain left the port of Honfleur in 1604 and founded Acadia. Four years later, he founded the City of Qu\u00e9bec. From then onwards, Normans engaged in a policy of expansion in North America. They continued the exploration of the New World: Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier de La Salle travelled in the area of the Great Lakes, then on the Mississippi River. Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and his brother Lemoyne de Bienville founded Louisiana, Biloxi, Mobile and New Orleans. Territories located between Qu\u00e9bec and the Mississippi Delta were opened up to establish Canada and Louisiana. Colonists from Normandy were among the most active in New France, comprising Acadia, Canada, and Louisiana.\nHonfleur and Le Havre were two of the principal slave trade ports of France.\nModern history.\nAlthough agriculture remained important, industries such as weaving, metallurgy, sugar refining, ceramics, and shipbuilding were introduced and developed.\nIn the 1780s, the economic crisis and the crisis of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" struck Normandy as well as other parts of the nation, leading to the French Revolution. Bad harvests, technical progress and the effects of the Eden Agreement signed in 1786 affected employment and the economy of the province. Normans laboured under a heavy fiscal burden.\nIn 1790 the five departments of Normandy replaced the former province.\n13 July 1793, the Norman Charlotte Corday assassinated Marat.\nThe Normans reacted little to the many political upheavals which characterized the 19th century. Overall they warily accepted the changes of r\u00e9gime (First French Empire, Bourbon Restoration, July Monarchy, French Second Republic, Second French Empire, French Third Republic).\nFollowing the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars (1792\u20131815) there was an economic revival that included the mechanization of textile manufacturing and the introduction of the first trains.\nWith seaside tourism in the 19th century came the advent of the first beach resorts.\nDuring the Second World War, following the armistice of 22 June 1940, continental Normandy was part of the German occupied zone of France. The Channel Islands were occupied by German forces between 30 June 1940 and 9 May 1945. The town of Dieppe was the site of the unsuccessful Dieppe Raid by Canadian and British armed forces.\nThe Allies, in this case involving Britain, the United States, Canada and Free France, coordinated a massive build-up of troops and supplies to support a large-scale invasion of Normandy in the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord. The Germans were dug into fortified emplacements above the beaches. Caen, Cherbourg, Carentan, Falaise and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the Battle of Normandy, which continued until the closing of the so-called Falaise gap between Chambois and Mont Ormel. The liberation of Le Havre followed. This was a significant turning point in the war and led to the restoration of the French Republic.\nThe remainder of Normandy was liberated only on 9 May 1945 at the end of the war, when the Channel Island occupation effectively ended.\nGeography.\nThe historical Duchy of Normandy was a formerly independent duchy occupying the lower Seine area, the Pays de Caux and the region to the west through the Pays d'Auge as far as the Cotentin Peninsula and Channel Islands.\nWestern Normandy belongs to the Armorican Massif, while most of the region lies in the Paris Basin. France's oldest rocks are exposed in Jobourg, on the Cotentin peninsula. The region is bounded to the north and west by the English Channel. There are granite cliffs in the west and limestone cliffs in the east. There are also long stretches of beach in the centre of the region. The \"bocage\" typical of the western areas caused problems for the invading forces in the Battle of Normandy. A notable feature of the landscape is created by the meanders of the Seine as it approaches its estuary.\nThe highest point is the Signal d'\u00c9couves (417\u00a0m), in the Armorican Massif.\nNormandy is sparsely forested: 12.8% of the territory is wooded, compared to a French average of 23.6%, although the proportion varies between the departments. Eure has the most cover, at 21%, while Manche has the least, at 4%, a characteristic shared with the Channel Islands.\nSub-regions.\nInsular Normandy (Channel Islands).\nThe Channel Islands are considered culturally and historically a part of Normandy. However, they are British Crown Dependencies, and are not part of the modern French administrative region of Normandy,\nAlthough the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy, France, and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands. The Channel Islands (except for Chausey) remain Crown Dependencies of the British Crown in the present era. Thus the Loyal Toast in the Channel Islands is \"Le Roi, notre Duc\" (\"The King, our Duke\"). The British monarch is understood to \"not\" be the Duke with regards to mainland Normandy described herein, by virtue of the Treaty of Paris of 1259, the surrender of French possessions in 1801, and the belief that the rights of succession to that title are subject to Salic Law which excludes inheritance through female heirs.\nRivers.\nRivers in Normandy include:\nAnd many coastal rivers:\nPolitics.\nMainland Normandy.\nThe modern region of Normandy was created by the territorial reform of French Regions in 2014 by the merger of Lower Normandy, and Upper Normandy. The new region took effect on 1 January 2016, after the regional elections in December 2015.\nThe Regional Council has 102 members who are elected under a system of proportional representation. The executive consists of a president and vice-presidents. Herv\u00e9 Morin from the Centre party was elected president of the council in January 2016.\nChannel Islands.\nThe Channel Islands are not part of French territory, but are instead British Crown Dependencies. They are self-governing, each having its own parliament, government and legal system. The head of state of both territories is Charles III and each have an appointed Lieutenant-Governor.\nThe Bailiwick of Guernsey comprises three separate jurisdictions: Guernsey, Alderney and Sark. Administratively, Herm forms part of Guernsey.\nEconomy.\nMuch of Normandy is predominantly agricultural in character, with cattle breeding the most important sector (although in decline from the peak levels of the 1970s and 1980s). The \"bocage\" is a patchwork of small fields with high hedges, typical of western areas. Areas near the Seine (the former Upper Normandy region) contain a higher concentration of industry. Normandy is a significant cider-producing region, and also produces calvados, a distilled cider or apple brandy. Other activities of economic importance are dairy produce, flax (60% of production in France), horse breeding (including two French national stud farms), fishing, seafood, and tourism. The region contains three French nuclear power stations.\nThere is also easy access to and from the UK using the ports of Cherbourg, Caen (Ouistreham), Le Havre and Dieppe. Jersey and Guernsey are often considered to be tax havens, due to having large financial services sectors and low tax rates.\nDemographics.\nIn January 2006 the population of French Normandy (including the part of Perche which lies inside the Orne \"d\u00e9partement\" but excluding the Channel Islands) was estimated at 3,260,000 with an average population density of 109 inhabitants per km2, just under the French national average, but rising to 147 for Upper Normandy. The population of the Channel Islands is estimated around 174,000 (2021).\nThe main cities (population given from the 1999 census) are Rouen (518,316 in the metropolitan area), the capital since 2016 of the province and formerly of Upper Normandy; Caen (420,000 in the metropolitan area) and formerly the capital of Lower Normandy; Le Havre (296,773 in the metropolitan area); and Cherbourg (117,855 in the metropolitan area).\nCulture.\nFlag.\nThe traditional provincial flag of Normandy, \"gules, two leopards passant or\", is used in the region and its predecessors. The three-leopard version (known in the Norman language as \"les treis cats\", \"the three cats\") is used by some associations and individuals, especially those who support cultural links with the Channel Islands and England. Jersey and Guernsey use three leopards in their national symbols. The leopards represents the strength and courage Normandy has towards the neighbouring provinces.\nThe unofficial anthem of the region is the song \"Ma Normandie\".\nLanguage.\nThe Norman language, including its insular variations J\u00e8rriais and Guern\u00e9siais, is a regional language, spoken by a minority of the population on the continent and the islands, with a concentration in the Cotentin Peninsula in the far west (the Cotentinais dialect), and in the Pays de Caux in the East (the Cauchois dialect).\nMany words and place names demonstrate the Old English and Norse (Anglo-Scandinavian) influence in this O\u00efl language; for example, words : \"mauve\" (seagull), \"fifotte\" (starfish), \"h\u00e2\" (catshark), \"mucre\" (humid, wet), \"(\u00e9)griller\" (slide, slip), \"fale\" (throat), etc. place-names : \"-bec\" (stream), \"-fleur\" (river), \"-hou\" (island), \"-tot\" (homestead), \"-dal\" / \"-dalle\" (valley), \"Hogue\" / \"Hougue\" (hill, mound), \"-lon\" / \"-londe\" (grove, wood), \"-vy\" / \"-vic\" (bay, cove), \"-mare\" (pond), \"-beuf\" (booth, cabin), etc. French is the only official language in continental Normandy and English is also an official language in the Channel Islands.\nArchitecture.\nArchitecturally, Norman cathedrals, abbeys (such as the Abbey of Bec) and castles characterise the former duchy in a way that mirrors the similar pattern of Norman architecture in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066.\nDomestic architecture in upper Normandy is typified by half-timbered buildings that also recall vernacular English architecture, although the farm enclosures of the more harshly landscaped Pays de Caux are a more idiosyncratic response to socio-economic and climatic imperatives. Much urban architectural heritage was destroyed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944 \u2013 post-war urban reconstruction, such as in Le Havre and Saint-L\u00f4, could be said to demonstrate both the virtues and vices of modernist and brutalist trends of the 1950s and 1960s. Le Havre, the city rebuilt by Auguste Perret, was added to Unesco's World Heritage List in 2005.\nVernacular architecture in lower Normandy takes its form from granite, the predominant local building material. The Channel Islands also share this influence \u2013 Chausey was for many years a source of quarried granite, including that used for the construction of Mont Saint-Michel.\nThe south part of Bagnoles-de-l'Orne is filled with bourgeois villas in \"Belle \u00c9poque\" style with polychrome fa\u00e7ades, bow windows and unique roofing. This area, built between 1886 and 1914, has an authentic \u201cBagnolese\u201d style and is typical of high-society country vacation of the time. The Chapel of Saint Germanus (\"Chapelle Saint-Germain\") at Querqueville with its trefoil floorplan incorporates elements of one of the earliest surviving places of Christian worship in the Cotentin \u2013 perhaps second only to the Gallo-Roman baptistry at Port-Bail. It is dedicated to Germanus of Normandy.\nGastronomy.\nParts of Normandy consist of rolling countryside typified by pasture for dairy cattle and apple orchards. A wide range of dairy products are produced and exported. Norman cheeses include Camembert, Livarot, Pont l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Brillat-Savarin, Neufch\u00e2tel, Petit Suisse and Boursin. Normandy butter and Normandy cream are lavishly used in gastronomic specialties. Jersey and Guernsey cattle are famous cattle breeds worldwide, especially to North America.\nTurbot and oysters from the Cotentin Peninsula are major delicacies throughout France. Normandy is the chief oyster-cultivating, scallop-exporting, and mussel-raising region in France.\nNormandy is a major cider-producing region (very little wine is produced). Perry is also produced, but in less significant quantities. Apple brandy, of which the most famous variety is calvados, is also popular. The mealtime \"trou normand\", or \"Norman hole\", is a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the appetite and make room for the next course, and this is still observed in many homes and restaurants. \"Pommeau\" is an \"ap\u00e9ritif\" produced by blending unfermented cider and apple brandy. Another aperitif is the \"kir normand\", a measure of cr\u00e8me de cassis topped up with cider. \"B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine\" is produced in F\u00e9camp.\nOther regional specialities include \"tripes \u00e0 la mode de Caen\", \"andouilles\" and \"andouillettes\", salade cauchoise, salt meadow (\"pr\u00e9 sal\u00e9\") lamb, seafood (mussels, scallops, lobsters, mackerel...), and \"teurgoule\" (spiced rice pudding).\nNormandy dishes include duckling \"\u00e0 la rouennaise\", saut\u00e9ed chicken \"yvetois\", and goose \"en daube\". Rabbit is cooked with morels, or \"\u00e0 la havraise\" (stuffed with truffled pigs' trotters). Other dishes are sheep's trotters \"\u00e0 la rouennaise\", casseroled veal, larded calf's liver braised with carrots, and veal (or turkey) in cream and mushrooms.\nNormandy is also noted for its pastries. Normandy turns out \"douillons\" (pears baked in pastry), \"craquelins\", \"roulettes\" in Rouen, \"fouaces\" in Caen, \"fallues\" in Lisieux, \"sabl\u00e9s\" in Lisieux. It is the birthplace of brioches (especially those from \u00c9vreux and Gisors). Confectionery of the region includes Rouen apple sugar, Isigny caramels, Bayeux mint chews, Falaise berlingots, Le Havre marzipans, Argentan \"croquettes\", and Rouen macaroons.\nNormandy is the native land of Taillevent, cook of the kings of France Charles V and Charles VI. He wrote the earliest French cookery book named \"Le Viandier\". \"Confiture de lait\" was also made in Normandy around the 14th century.\nLiterature.\nThe dukes of Normandy commissioned and inspired epic literature to record and legitimise their rule. Wace, Orderic Vitalis and Stephen of Rouen were among those who wrote in the service of the dukes. After the division of 1204, French literature provided the model for the development of literature in Normandy. Olivier Basselin wrote of the Vaux de Vire, the origin of literary \"vaudeville\". Notable Norman writers include Jean Marot, R\u00e9my Belleau, Guy de Maupassant, Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly, Gustave Flaubert, Octave Mirbeau, and Remy de Gourmont, and Alexis de Tocqueville. The Corneille brothers, Pierre and Thomas, born in Rouen, were great figures of French classical literature.\nDavid Ferrand (1591\u20131660) in his \"Muse Normande\" established a landmark of Norman language literature. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the workers and merchants of Rouen established a tradition of polemical and satirical literature in a form of language called the \"parler purin\". At the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century a new movement arose in the Channel Islands, led by writers such as George M\u00e9tivier, which sparked a literary renaissance on the Norman mainland. In exile in Jersey and then Guernsey, Victor Hugo took an interest in the vernacular literature. \"Les Travailleurs de la mer\" is a well-known novel by Hugo set in the Channel Islands. The boom in insular literature in the early 19th century encouraged production especially in La Hague and around Cherbourg, where Alfred Rossel, Louis Beuve and C\u00f4tis-Capel became active. The typical medium for literary expression in Norman has traditionally been newspaper columns and almanacs. The novel \"Zabeth\" by Andr\u00e9 Louis which appeared in 1969 was the first novel published in Norman.\nPainting.\nNormandy has a rich tradition of painting and gave to France some of its most important artists.\nIn the 17th century some major French painters were Normans like Nicolas Poussin, born in Les Andelys and Jean Jouvenet.\nRomanticism drew painters to the Channel coasts of Normandy. Richard Parkes Bonington and J. M. W. Turner crossed the Channel from Great Britain, attracted by the light and landscapes. Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, a native of Rouen, was a notable figure in the Romantic movement, its famous \"Radeau de la M\u00e9duse\" being considered come the breakthrough of pictorial romanticism in France when it was officially presented at the 1819 Salon. The competing Realist tendency was represented by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, a native of La Hague. The landscape painter Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, born in Honfleur, was a determining influence on the impressionists and was highly considered by Monet.\nBreaking away from the more formalised and classical themes of the early part of the 19th century, Impressionist painters preferred to paint outdoors, in natural light, and to concentrate on landscapes, towns and scenes of daily life.\nLeader of the movement and father of modern painting, Claude Monet is one of the best known Impressionists and a major character in Normandy's artistic heritage. His house and gardens at Giverny are one of the region's major tourist sites, much visited for their beauty and their water lilies, as well as for their importance to Monet's artistic inspiration. Normandy was at the heart of his creation, from the paintings of Rouen's cathedral to the famous depictions of the cliffs at \u00c9tretat, the beach and port at F\u00e9camp and the sunrise at Le Havre. It was \"Impression, Sunrise\", Monet's painting of Le Havre, that led to the movement being dubbed Impressionism. After Monet, all the main avant-garde painters of the 1870s and 1880s came to Normandy to paint its landscapes and its changing lights, concentrating along the Seine valley and the Norman coast.\nLandscapes and scenes of daily life were also immortalised on canvas by artists that have included : William Turner, Gustave Courbet, the Honfleur born Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Eug\u00e8ne Chigot, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. While Monet's work adorns galleries and collections all over the world, a remarkable quantity of Impressionist works can be found in galleries throughout Normandy, such as the Museum of Fine Arts in Rouen, the Mus\u00e9e Eug\u00e8ne Boudin in Honfleur or the Andr\u00e9 Malraux Museum in Le Havre.\nMaurice Denis, one of the leaders and theoricists of the Nabis movement in the 1890s, was a native of Granville, in the department of Manche. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Auffray, an expressionist painter and member of the French resistance during WWII, lived and painted in the village of \u00c9chauffour.\nThe \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Normande de Peinture Moderne\" was founded in 1909 by Pierre Dumont, Robert Antoine Pinchon, Yvonne Barbier and Eug\u00e8ne Tirvert. Among members were Raoul Dufy, a native of Le Havre, Albert Marquet, Francis Picabia and Maurice Utrillo. Also in this movement were the Duchamp brothers, Jacques Villon and Marcel Duchamp, considered one of the father of modern art, also natives of Normandy. Jean Dubuffet, one of the leading French artist of the 1940s and the 1950s was born in Le Havre.\nReligion.\nChristian missionaries implanted monastic communities in the territory in the 5th and 6th centuries. Some of these missionaries came from across the Channel. The influence of Celtic Christianity can still be found in the Cotentin. By the terms of the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Rollo, a Viking pagan, accepted Christianity and was baptised. The Duchy of Normandy was therefore formally a Christian state from its foundation. The cathedrals of Normandy have exerted influence down the centuries in matters of both faith and politics. King Henry II of England, did penance at the cathedral of Avranches on 21 May 1172 and was absolved from the censures incurred by the assassination of Thomas Becket. Mont Saint-Michel is a historic pilgrimage site.\nNormandy does not have one generally agreed patron saint, although this title has been ascribed to Saint Michael, and to Saint Ouen. Many saints have been revered in Normandy down the centuries, including:\nSince the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State there is no established church in mainland Normandy. In the Channel Islands, the Church of England is the established church."}
{"id": "21725", "revid": "3091149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21725", "title": "Neuromancer", "text": "Neuromancer is a 1984 science fiction novel by American-Canadian writer William Gibson. Considered one of the earliest and best-known works in the cyberpunk genre, it is the only novel to win the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award. It was Gibson's debut novel and the beginning of the Sprawl trilogy. Set in the future, the novel follows Henry Case, a washed-up hacker hired for one last job, which brings him in contact with a powerful artificial intelligence.\nBackground.\nBefore \"Neuromancer\", Gibson had written several short stories for US science fiction periodicals\u2014mostly noir countercultural narratives concerning low-life protagonists in near-future encounters with cyberspace. The themes he developed in this early short fiction, the Sprawl setting of \"Burning Chrome\" (1982), and the character of Molly Millions from \"Johnny Mnemonic\" (1981) laid the foundations for the novel. John Carpenter's \"Escape from New York\" (1981) influenced the novel; Gibson was \"intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF, where a casual reference can imply a lot.\" The novel's street and computer slang dialogue derives from the vocabulary of subcultures, particularly \"1969 Toronto dope dealer's slang, or biker talk\". Gibson heard the term \"flatlining\" in a bar around twenty years before writing \"Neuromancer\" and it stuck with him. Author Robert Stone, a \"master of a certain kind of paranoid fiction\", was a primary influence on the novel. The term \"Screaming Fist\" was taken from the song of the same name by Toronto-based punk rock band The Viletones.\n\"Neuromancer\" was commissioned by Terry Carr for the second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials, which was intended to feature debut novels exclusively. Given a year to complete the work, Gibson undertook the actual writing out of \"blind animal panic\" at the obligation to write an entire novel\u2014a feat which he felt he was \"four or five years away from\". After viewing the first 20 minutes of the landmark film \"Blade Runner\" (1982), which was released when Gibson had written a third of the novel, he \"figured [\"Neuromancer\"] was sunk, done for. Everyone would assume I'd copied my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film.\" He re-wrote the first two-thirds of the book 12 times, feared losing the reader's attention and was convinced that he would be \"permanently shamed\" following its publication; yet what resulted was seen as a major imaginative leap forward for a first-time novelist. He added the final sentence of the novel at the last minute in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, but ended up doing precisely that with \"Count Zero\" (1986), a character-focused work set in the Sprawl alluded to in its predecessor.\nPlot.\nHenry Dorsett Case is a low-level hustler in the dystopian underworld of Chiba City, Japan. Once a talented computer hacker and \"console cowboy\", Case was caught stealing from his employer. As punishment, Case's central nervous system was damaged, leaving him unable to access the virtual reality dataspace called the \"matrix\". Case is approached by Molly Millions, an augmented \"razorgirl\" and mercenary on behalf of a shadowy US ex-military officer named Armitage, who offers to cure Case for his services as a hacker. Case agrees, and his nervous system is repaired, though sacs of poison are placed in his blood vessels. If Case completes the job, Armitage will have the sacs removed; if not, they will burst and cripple him again.\nArmitage has Case and Molly steal a ROM module that contains the saved consciousness of one of Case's mentors, legendary cyber-cowboy McCoy Pauley.\nCase and Molly discover Armitage's former identity as Colonel Willis Corto. Corto was a member of \"Operation Screaming Fist,\" meant to disrupt Soviet computer systems. As his team attacked a Soviet computer center, EMP weapons shut down their flight systems. He and a few survivors escaped over the Finnish border, but their helicopter was shot down, killing everyone except for Corto. After months in a hospital, Corto was visited by a US government official, who returned him to the United States to receive psychotherapy and reconstructive surgery. After providing what he came to realize was false testimony, misleading the public and protecting corrupt military officers, Corto snapped, killed the official who contacted him, and disappeared into the criminal underworld, becoming Armitage.\nIn Istanbul, the team recruits Peter Riviera, a sociopathic thief and drug addict. The trail leads Case to Wintermute, an artificial intelligence created by the Tessier-Ashpool family. The Tessier-Ashpools spend their time in cryonic preservation at Freeside, a cylindrical space habitat which functions as a Las Vegas-style space resort for the wealthy.\nWintermute reveals itself to Case and explains that it is one half of a super-AI entity planned by the family. It has been programmed with a need to merge with its other half, Neuromancer, and has recruited Armitage and his team since it cannot achieve this goal by itself. Case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the software barriers with an icebreaker program. Riviera is to obtain the password to the lock from Lady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool, the CEO of the family's corporation.\nArmitage's personality starts to revert to the Corto personality as he relives Screaming Fist. It is revealed that Wintermute had originally contacted Corto through a computer during his psychotherapy, creating his Armitage persona. As Corto breaks through, he is uncontrollable, and Wintermute ejects him into space.\nRiviera meets Lady 3Jane and tries to stop the mission, helping Lady 3Jane and Hideo, her ninja bodyguard, capture Molly. Under orders from Wintermute, Case tracks Molly down. Neuromancer traps Case within a simulated reality after he enters cyberspace. He finds the consciousness of Linda Lee, his girlfriend from Chiba City, who was murdered by one of his underworld contacts. He also meets Neuromancer, who takes the form of a young boy. Neuromancer tries to convince Case to remain in the virtual world with Linda, but Case refuses.\nWith Wintermute guiding them, Case goes to confront Lady 3Jane, Riviera, and Hideo. Riviera tries to kill Case, but Lady 3Jane is sympathetic towards Case and Molly, and Hideo protects him. Riviera flees, and Molly explains that he is doomed anyway, as she had spiked his drugs with a lethal toxin. The team makes it to the computer terminal. Case enters cyberspace to guide the icebreaker; Lady 3Jane is induced to give up her password, and the lock opens. Wintermute unites with Neuromancer, becoming a superconsciousness. The poison in Case's bloodstream is washed out and he and Molly are profusely paid, while Pauley's ROM construct is apparently erased at his own request.\nMolly leaves Case, who finds a new girlfriend and resumes his hacking work. Wintermute/Neuromancer contacts him, claiming it has become \"the sum total of the works, the whole show\" and is looking for others like itself. Scanning recorded transmissions, the super-AI finds a transmission from the Alpha Centauri star system.\nWhile logged into cyberspace, Case glimpses Neuromancer standing in the distance with Linda Lee, and himself. He also hears inhuman laughter, which suggests that Pauley still lives. The sighting implies that Neuromancer created a copy of Case's consciousness, which now exists in cyberspace with those of Linda and Pauley.\nLiterary and cultural significance.\nDave Langford reviewed \"Neuromancer\" for \"White Dwarf\" #59, and stated that \"I spent the whole time on the edge of my seat and got a cramp as a result. In a way Gibson's pace is too frenetic, so unremitting that the reader never gets a rest and can't see the plot for the dazzle. Otherwise: nice one.\"\nDave Langford also reviewed \"Neuromancer\" for \"White Dwarf\" #80, and stated that \"You may not believe in killer programs which invade the brain, but \"Neuromancer\", if you once let it into your wetware, isn't easily erased.\"\n\"Neuromancer\"s release was not greeted with fanfare, but it hit a cultural nerve, quickly becoming an underground word-of-mouth hit. It became the first novel to win the Nebula, the Hugo, and Philip K. Dick Award for paperback original, an unprecedented achievement described by the \"Mail &amp; Guardian\" as \"the sci-fi writer's version of winning the Goncourt, Booker and Pulitzer prizes in the same year\". The novel thereby legitimized cyberpunk as a mainstream branch of science fiction literature. It is among the most-honored works of science fiction in recent history, and appeared on \"Time\" magazine's list of 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. The novel was also nominated for a British Science Fiction Award in 1984.\n\"Neuromancer\" is considered \"the archetypal cyberpunk work\". Outside science fiction, it gained unprecedented critical and popular attention as an \"evocation of life in the late 1980s\", although \"The Observer\" noted that \"it took the \"New York Times\" 10 years\" to mention the novel. By 2007 it had sold more than 6.5\u00a0million copies worldwide.\nThe novel has had significant linguistic influence, popularizing such terms as cyberspace and ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics). Gibson himself coined the term \"cyberspace\" in his novelette \"Burning Chrome\", published in 1982 by \"Omni\" magazine, but it was through its use in \"Neuromancer\" that it gained recognition to become the \"de facto\" term for the \"World Wide Web\" during the 1990s. The portion of \"Neuromancer\" usually cited in this respect is:\nThe 1999 cyberpunk science fiction film \"The Matrix\" particularly draws from \"Neuromancer\" both eponym and usage of the term \"matrix\". \"After watching \"The Matrix\", Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was 'exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis\" he had relied upon in his own writing.\"\nIn his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of \"Neuromancer\", fellow author Jack Womack goes as far as to suggest that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet developed (particularly the World Wide Web), after the publication of \"Neuromancer\" in 1984. He asks \"[w]hat if the act of writing it down, in fact, \"brought it about?\"\" (269).\nNorman Spinrad, in his 1986 essay \"The Neuromantics\" which appears in his non-fiction collection \"Science Fiction in the Real World\", acknowledged the book's title as a triple pun: \"neuro\" referring to the nervous system; \"necromancer\"; and \"new romancer\". The cyberpunk genre, the authors of which he suggested be called \"neuromantics\", was \"a fusion of the romantic impulse with science and technology\", according to Spinrad.\nWriting in \"F&amp;SF\" in 2005, Charles de Lint noted that while Gibson's technological extrapolations had proved imperfect (in particular, his failure to anticipate the cellular telephone), \"Imagining story, the inner workings of his characters' minds, and the world in which it all takes place are all more important.\"\nLawrence Person in his \"Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto\" (1998) identified \"Neuromancer\" as \"the archetypal cyberpunk work\". Literary critic Larry McCaffery described the concept of the matrix in \"Neuromancer\" as a place where \"data dance with human consciousness... human memory is literalized and mechanized... multi-national information systems mutate and breed into startling new structures whose beauty and complexity are unimaginable, mystical, and above all nonhuman.\" Gibson later commented on himself as an author circa \"Neuromancer\" that \"I'd buy him a drink, but I don't know if I'd loan him any money,\" and referred to the novel as \"an adolescent's book\". The success of \"Neuromancer\" was to effect the 35-year-old Gibson's emergence from obscurity.\nAdaptations.\nGraphic novel.\nIn 1989, Epic Comics published a 48-page graphic novel version by Tom de Haven and Bruce Jensen. It only covers the first two chapters, \"Chiba City Blues\" and \"The Shopping Expedition\", and was never continued.\nHypertext.\nIn the 1990s a version of \"Neuromancer\" was published as one of the Voyager Company's \"Expanded Books\" series of hypertext-annotated HyperCard stacks for the Apple Macintosh (especially the PowerBook).\nVideo game.\nA video game adaptation of the novel\u2014also titled \"Neuromancer\"\u2014was published in 1988 by Interplay. Designed by Bruce J. Balfour, Brian Fargo, Troy A. Miles, and Michael A. Stackpole, the game had many of the same locations and themes as the novel, but a different protagonist and plot. It was available for a variety of platforms, including the Amiga, the Apple II, the Commodore 64, and for DOS-based computers.\nAccording to an episode of the American version of \"Beyond 2000\", the original plans for the game included a dynamic soundtrack composed by Devo and a real-time 3D-rendered movie of the events the player went through. Psychologist and futurist Dr. Timothy Leary was involved, but very little documentation seems to exist about this proposed second game, which was perhaps too grand a vision for 1988 home computing.\nRadio play.\nThe BBC World Service Drama production of \"Neuromancer\" aired in two one-hour parts, on 8 and 15 September 2002. Dramatised by Mike Walker, and directed by Andy Jordan, it starred Owen McCarthy as Case, Nicola Walker as Molly, James Laurenson as Armitage, John Shrapnel as Wintermute, Colin Stinton as Dixie, David Webber as Maelcum, David Holt as Riviera, Peter Marinker as Ashpool, and Andrew Scott as The Finn. It can no longer be heard on The BBC World Service Archive. \nIn Finland, Yle Radioteatteri produced a 4-part radio play of Neuromancer.\nAudiobook.\nGibson read an abridged version of his novel \"Neuromancer\" on four audio cassettes for Time Warner Audio Books (1994), which are now unavailable. An unabridged version of this book was read by Arthur Addison and made available from Books on Tape (1997). In 2011, Penguin Audiobooks produced a new unabridged recording of the book, read by Robertson Dean.\nOpera.\n\"Neuromancer the Opera\" is an adaptation written by Jayne Wenger and Marc Lowenstein (libretto) and Richard Marriott of the Club Foot Orchestra (music). A production was scheduled to open on March 3, 1995 at the Julia Morgan Theater (now the Julia Morgan Center for the Arts) in Berkeley, California, featuring Club Foot Orchestra in the pit and extensive computer graphics imagery created by a world-wide network of volunteers. However, this premiere did not take place and the work has yet to be performed in full.\nFilm.\nThere have been several proposed film adaptations of \"Neuromancer\", with drafts of scripts written by British director Chris Cunningham and Chuck Russell, with Aphex Twin providing the soundtrack. The box packaging for the video game adaptation had even carried the promotional mention for a major motion picture to come from \"Cabana Boy Productions.\" None of these projects have come to fruition, though Gibson had stated his belief that Cunningham is the only director with a chance of doing the film correctly.\nIn May 2007, reports emerged that a film was in the works, with Joseph Kahn (director of \"Torque\") in line to direct and Milla Jovovich in the lead role. In May 2010 this story was supplanted with news that Vincenzo Natali, director of \"Cube\" and \"Splice\", had taken over directing duties and would rewrite the screenplay. In March 2011, with the news that Seven Arts and GFM Films would be merging their distribution operations, it was announced that the joint venture would be purchasing the rights to \"Neuromancer\" under Vincenzo Natali's direction. In August, 2012, GFM Films announced that it had begun casting for the film (with offers made to Liam Neeson and Mark Wahlberg), but no cast members have been confirmed yet. In November 2013, Natali shed some light on the production situation; announcing that the script had been completed for \"years\", and had been written with assistance from Gibson himself. In May 2015, it was reported the movie got new funding from Chinese company C2M, but Natali was no longer available for directing.\nIn August 2017, it was announced that \"Deadpool\" director Tim Miller was signed on to direct a new film adaptation by Fox, with Simon Kinberg producing.\nTelevision.\nIn November 2022 Apple TV+ released ads for the series Neuromancer that is beginning production in Summer of 2023."}

{"id": "21728", "revid": "44820619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21728", "title": "New York Mets", "text": "The New York Mets are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of Queens. The Mets compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the American League's (AL) New York Yankees. One of baseball's first expansion teams, the Mets were founded in 1962 to replace New York's departed NL teams, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. The team's colors evoke the blue of the Dodgers and the orange of the Giants.\nFor the 1962 and 1963 seasons, the Mets played home games at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan before moving to Queens. From 1964 to 2008, the Mets played their home games at Shea Stadium, named after William Shea, the founder of the Continental League, a proposed third major league, the announcement of which prompted their admission as an NL expansion team. Since 2009, the Mets have played their home games at Citi Field next to the site where Shea Stadium once stood.\nIn their inaugural season, the Mets posted a record of 40\u2013120, the worst regular-season record since MLB went to a 162-game schedule. The team never finished better than second-to-last in the 1960s until the \"Miracle Mets\" beat the Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series, considered one of the biggest upsets in World Series history despite the Mets having won 100 games that season. The Mets have qualified for the postseason ten times, winning the World Series twice (1969 and 1986) and winning five National League pennants (most recently in 2000 and 2015), and six National League East division titles.\nSince 2020, the Mets have been owned by billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, who purchased the team for $2.4 billion. As of 2022, \"Forbes\" ranked the Mets as the sixth valuable MLB team, valued at $2.650 billion.\nAs of the end of the 2022 regular season, the team's overall win\u2013loss record is 4,652\u20134,988 ().\nFranchise history.\n1960s: Founding and first World Series.\nAfter the 1957 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated from New York to California to become the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, leaving the largest city in the United States with no National League franchise and only one major league team, the New York Yankees of the American League (AL). With the threat of a New York team joining a new third league, the National League expanded by adding the New York Mets following a proposal from William Shea. In a symbolic reference to New York's earlier National League teams, the new team took as its primary colors the blue of the Dodgers and the orange of the Giants, both of which are colors also featured on the Flag of New York City. The nickname \"Mets\" was adopted: being a natural shorthand to the club's corporate name, the \"New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.\", which hearkened back to the \"Metropolitans\" (a New York team in the American Association from 1880 to 1887), and its brevity was advantageous for newspaper headlines.\nThe 1962 Mets posted a 40\u2013120 record, a major league record for the most losses in a season since 1899. During the 1963 season the team featured a pitcher, Carlton Willey, who was having a great year, pitching four shut-outs, when he incurred an injury and finished with a 9\u201314 win\u2013loss record. The '63 squad also had Duke Snider, who hit his 2,000th hit and later his 400th home run and earned a berth to the 1963 All-Star Game. In 1964, the Mets hired Yogi Berra as a coach under Casey Stengel's coaching staff.\nIn 1966, the Mets famously bypassed future Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson in the amateur draft, instead selecting Steve Chilcott, who never played in the majors. But the following year, they acquired future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver in a lottery. Seaver helped the 1969 \"Miracle Mets\" win the new National League East division title, then defeat the Atlanta Braves to win the National League pennant and the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles to win the 1969 World Series.\n1970s: Second pennant and the \"Midnight Massacre\".\nIn 1973, the Mets rallied from 5th place to win the division, despite a record of only 82\u201379. They shocked the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds' \"Big Red Machine\" in the NLCS and pushed the defending World Series champion Oakland Athletics to a seventh game, but lost the series. Notably, 1973 was the only NL East title between 1970 and 1980 that was not won by either the Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates. Star pitcher Tom Seaver was traded in 1977, on a day remembered as \"the Midnight Massacre\", and the Mets fell into last place for several years.\n1980s: Success, Wilpon takes over and second World Series championship.\nIn January 1980, the Payson heirs sold the Mets franchise to the Doubleday publishing company for $21.1 million, a record amount at that time. Nelson Doubleday, Jr. was named chairman of the board while minority shareholder Fred Wilpon took the role of club president. In February, Wilpon hired longtime Baltimore Orioles executive Frank Cashen as general manager who began the process of rebuilding the Mets much in the same way he developed the Orioles in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nThe franchise turned around in the mid-1980s. During this time the Mets drafted slugger Darryl Strawberry (#1 in 1980) and 1985 Cy Young Award winner Dwight Gooden (#5 in 1982). Former National League MVP and perennial Gold Glove winner Keith Hernandez was obtained by the Mets in 1983. After finishing their first three campaigns of the 1980s decade in either 5th or 6th (last) place, in 1984, new manager Davey Johnson was promoted from the helm of the AAA Tidewater Tides. He led the Mets to a second-place, 90\u201372 record, their first winning season since 1976.\nIn 1985, they acquired Hall of Fame catcher Gary Carter from the Montreal Expos and won 98 games, but narrowly missed the playoffs. In 1986, they won the division with a record of 108\u201354, one of the best in National League history. They then won a dramatic NLCS in six games over the Houston Astros.\nThe sixth game of the series lasted sixteen innings, the longest playoff game in history until 2005. The Mets came within one strike of losing the World Series against the Boston Red Sox before a series of hits and defensive miscues ultimately led to an error by Boston's Bill Buckner which gave the Mets a Game 6 victory. The Mets won their second World Series title in seven games.\nIn 1987 the Mets declined to re-sign World Series MVP Ray Knight, who then signed with the Baltimore Orioles and also traded away the flexible Kevin Mitchell to the Padres for long-ball threat Kevin McReynolds. Weeks later Mets' ace Dwight Gooden was admitted to a drug clinic after testing positive for cocaine. Despite Gooden struggling in the first few months of the 1987 season, \"Dr. K\" rebounded, as did the team. It was during the tough times that the Mets made a great long-term deal, trading Ed Hearn to the Kansas City Royals for pitcher David Cone.\nThey surged to battle St. Louis for the division title. They suffered two painful losses to the Cardinals. The first came on Seat Cushion Night where Tom Herr hit a walk-off grand slam. A greater loss came on September 11 in a game against St. Louis, 3rd baseman Terry Pendleton hit a homer to give the Cardinals a lead, and eventually the NL East title. One highlight of the year was Darryl Strawberry and Howard Johnson becoming the first teammates' ever to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in the same season. After posting a 100\u201360 overall record, the Mets won the division in 1988, but lost in the NLCS that year and declined into the 1990s.\n1990s: Struggles and return to the postseason.\nThe Mets struggled for much of the 1990s, finishing with a losing record for six consecutive seasons between 1991 and 1996. The Mets would not return to the postseason until 1999 after a one-game playoff against the Cincinnati Reds. Despite victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 1999 National League Division Series, the Mets were defeated by their NL East rivals, the Atlanta Braves, in the 1999 National League Championship Series in six games.\n2000s: The Subway World Series and new ballpark.\nIn 2000, the Mets finished the season with a 94\u201368 record and clinched a wild card spot in the playoffs. In the NLDS, the Mets defeated the San Francisco Giants 3\u20131 in the series and the St Louis Cardinals in the NLCS. After winning the National League pennant, the Mets earned a trip to the 2000 World Series against their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees, for a \"Subway Series\". The Mets were defeated by the Yankees in five games. The most memorable moment of the 2000 World Series occurred during the first inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium. Piazza fouled off a pitch which shattered his bat, sending a piece of the barrel toward the pitcher's mound. Pitcher Roger Clemens seized the piece and hurled it in the direction of Piazza as the catcher trotted to first base, benches briefly cleared before the game was resumed with no ejections.\nDuring the 2001 season, the Mets finished with a record of 82\u201380 finishing third in the division. After the September 11 terrorist attacks Shea Stadium was used as a relief center and then saw the first sporting event in New York City since the attacks, in a game vs. the Atlanta Braves on September 21. In the bottom of the 8th inning the Mets were trailing 2\u20131 when Mike Piazza came to bat with a runner on first. Piazza dramatically sent Shea into a frenzy by crushing a home run to give the Mets a 3\u20132 lead and the eventual win. The game is considered to be one of the greatest moments in the history of the franchise.\nIn 2002, despite the off-season signings of Tom Glavine, Mo Vaughn, and Roberto Alomar, the Mets finished the 2002 season with a 75-86 overall record and last in the NL East. During that same season the Mets dealt with off field distractions when co-owners Wilpon and Doubleday were in a legal battle which was later settled with Wilpon becoming the sole owner on August 23 that year.\nThe Mets nearly missed the playoffs in 2001 and struggled from 2002 to 2004. In the aftermath of the 2004 season, the Mets hired a new general manager, Omar Minaya, who immediately turned the franchise around by signing pitcher Pedro Mart\u00ednez and hiring a new manager, Willie Randolph. The Mets finished 2005 four games over .500, and the franchise's resurgence was complete by 2006 as they won 97 games and the NL East title behind new acquisitions Carlos Beltr\u00e1n and Carlos Delgado, as well as young superstars Jos\u00e9 Reyes and David Wright. The Mets eventually succumbed to the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series.\nIn 2007, the Mets entered the final 17 games in the season with a seven-game lead in the NL East. But the team went on an ill-timed losing streak, losing 11 of the next 15 games, resulting in the Philadelphia Phillies winning the division by one game.\nThe Mets held a more modest 3.5-game lead after 145 games of the 2008 season, their final season at Shea Stadium. On June 16, Omar Minaya fired Willie Randolph, Rick Peterson, and Tom Nieto. Jerry Manuel was named interim manager. While their 7\u201310 mark down the stretch was better than the previous season's 5\u201312, it still allowed the Phillies to pass them once again for the division crown.\nIn 2009, the Mets moved into the newly constructed Citi Field. On April 17, Gary Sheffield, who just days earlier was signed by the Mets as a free agent, hit his 500th home run against the Milwaukee Brewers. Sheffield became the first pinch hitter to reach this milestone, as well as the first to do it in a Mets uniform. The season was mainly a tough one for the Mets which was marred by numerous injuries suffered by its players, with 20 of them having been on the disabled list at one point or another during the season and losing star (and also replacement) players like J. J. Putz, John Maine, \u00d3liver P\u00e9rez, Jos\u00e9 Reyes, Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, David Wright, Carlos Delgado, Johan Santana, and Gary Sheffield.\nAs a result, the Mets finished in fourth place, with a record of 70\u201392 and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third straight season. Mets players spent more than 1,480 days in the disabled list in 2009, more than any other team in the majors. Second-half turnarounds of Jeff Francoeur and Daniel Murphy helped the Mets finish the season with the best batting average in the National League, tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n2010s: Wilpon sells the team and Fifth trip to the World Series.\nIn 2012, Mets owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz settled a lawsuit brought against them on behalf of the victims of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme for $162\u00a0million. As a result of this agreement the liquidator, Irving Picard, agreed to drop the charges that Wilpon and Katz blindly went along with the scheme for their personal benefit. Picard had originally sought to recover $1\u00a0billion from the Wilpon family and Katz, but settled for $162\u00a0million along with the admission that neither the Wilpons nor Katz had any knowledge of the Ponzi scheme. In 2011\u20132012, Mets ownership sold twelve minority 4% shares (totaling 48%) of the franchise at $20\u00a0million apiece to provide a cash infusion of $240\u00a0million for the team.\nThough the first half of the 2010s saw limited success for the Mets, who failed to finish with a winning record between 2009 and 2014, this period coincided with a number of milestones for the franchise, including the first no-hitter in franchise history by Johan Santana in 2012. R.A. Dickey won the NL Cy Young Award pitching for the Mets that same season.\nOn September 26, 2015, the Mets clinched the NL East division title, and thus their first postseason berth since 2006, by defeating the Cincinnati Reds 10\u20132. They defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS, three games to two, and swept the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS for their first pennant in 15 years. In the 2015 World Series, they were defeated by the Kansas City Royals in five games.\nThe Mets returned to the postseason in 2016, marking only the second time in franchise history that the team qualified for the postseason in consecutive years. With an 87\u201375 record, the team qualified for the wild-card game, only to lose 3\u20130 to the San Francisco Giants. The Mets failed to make the playoffs for the rest of the decade, finishing no higher than third place in 2019 when they finished with a winning record of 86\u201376 (the highest of any team not to qualify for the postseason).\nThe end of the decade also coincided with David Wright's retirement, Jacob deGrom being awarded two consecutive Cy Young Awards (including for the 2018 season when the pitcher finished the year with a 1.70 ERA) and first-baseman Pete Alonso winning the 2019 Rookie of the Year Award and finishing the season with a major-league-leading 53 home runs, the most by any rookie in MLB history. On October 3, 2019, the Mets fired manager Mickey Callaway. On November 1, 2019, the Mets named Carlos Beltr\u00e1n as the new manager replacing Callaway.\n2020s: Steve Cohen Era.\nOn January 16, 2020, Beltr\u00e1n stepped down as manager before the start of the 2020 season due to his involvement in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. Two days later, the Mets hired Luis Rojas as manager. The team finished the shortened 2020 season with a 26\u201334 record and a last-place finish in the NL East.\nOn October 30, 2020, Steve Cohen became the majority owner of the Mets, owning 95% of the team, making him the current richest owner in baseball. He bought the team from the Wilpon family for $2.475 billion, with the Wilpons keeping the remaining 5%. On January 7, 2021, the Mets acquired pitcher Carlos Carrasco and all-star shortstop Francisco Lindor in a trade with the Cleveland Indians. On April 1, 2021, Lindor and the Mets agreed to an extension worth $341 million for the next 11 years. At the trade deadline, the Mets acquired All-star infielder &amp; world series champion Javier B\u00e1ez in trade with the Chicago Cubs. The Mets finished third place in the NL East with an overall record of 77\u201385.\nOn November 19, 2021, the Mets hired Billy Eppler as the new general manager. During the 2021\u20132022 off-season, the Mets signed free agents Nick Plummer, Starling Marte, Eduardo Escobar, and Mark Canha. On December 1, the Mets signed three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer with a three-year $130 million deal. On December 18, the Mets announced hiring Buck Showalter as their manager via owner Steve Cohen's Twitter account. On April 29, 2022, Tylor Megill, Drew Smith, Joely Rodr\u00edguez, Seth Lugo and Edwin D\u00edaz pitched the second no-hitter in franchise history. At the trade deadline, the Mets added 1B/DH Daniel Vogelbach from the Pirates, OF Tyler Naquin from the Reds, and OF Darin Ruf from the Giants. On September 19, 2022 Jacob deGrom set a new MLB record by allowing three or less earned runs. On September 25, 2022 Pete Alonso broke the Mets single season RBI record which was previously set by former franchise stars Mike Piazza and David Wright. Also during the season, the Mets called up three of their top prospects Brett Baty, Mark Vientos, and Francisco \u00c1lvarez.\nWorld Series championships.\nThroughout the 60-year history of the franchise, the Mets have won 2 World Series Championships in total.\nCulture.\nFan support.\nIn 1998, the Independent Budget Office of the city of New York published a study on the economic effect of the city's two Major League Baseball teams. The study found that 43% of Mets fans lived in one of the five boroughs of New York, 39% in the tri-state area outside the city, and 12% elsewhere. Mets fans were more likely to be found in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Long Island counties of Nassau and Suffolk. Mets, Yankees, and Toronto Blue Jays fans are shared in Western New York. Notable fans of the Mets include Jerry Seinfeld, Kevin James, Julia Stiles, Ty Burrell, Bill Maher, Ben Stiller, Jimmy Kimmel, Hank Azaria, Jim Breuer, Jon Stewart, Chris Rock, Matthew Broderick, Dylan O'Brien, Glenn Close, Billy Joel, Ad-Rock, MCA, Nas, 50 Cent, Nicki Minaj, Chris Christie, Patrick Mahomes, and Donovan Mitchell.\nThe 7 Line Army.\nThe \"7 Line Army\" are a group primarily consisting of passionate and die-hard Mets fans occupying the Big Apple Section of Citi Field during home games for the Mets. The group was founded in 2012 by Darren Meenan who owns The 7 Line, an apparel company that produces Mets-themed clothing.\nMascots.\nMr. Met is the official mascot of the New York Mets. He was introduced on the cover of game programs in 1963, when the Mets were still playing at the Polo Grounds in northern Manhattan. When the Mets moved to Shea Stadium in 1964, fans were introduced to a live costumed version. Mr. Met is believed to have been the first mascot in Major League Baseball to exist in human (as opposed to artistically rendered) form.\nMrs. Met (formerly Lady Met) is the female counterpart to Mr. Met, and the couple sometimes appears with 2\u20133 smaller \"children\".\nThe Mets have had two mascots other than Mr. and Mrs. Met at different points in its history. The franchise's original official mascot was Homer, a beagle trained by Rudd Weatherwax that lived at the Waldorf-Astoria, was sponsored by Rheingold Beer and had his own platform behind home plate at the Polo Grounds. The dog was not included in the ballclub's transition to Shea Stadium. The brainchild of team owner Lorinda de Roulet's daughter Bebe, Mettle the mule represented the Mets for only the 1979 season. The name was the result of a contest won by Dolores Mapps of Mercerville, New Jersey whose explanation was that it typified the team's \"spirit, ardor, stamina and courage, all of which the Mets have in abundance.\" Mettle was not retained after the franchise was sold to Nelson Doubleday Jr. and Fred Wilpon the following year.\nTheme song.\n\"Meet the Mets\" is the Mets' signature song, written in 1961, one year before the first season, by Bill Katz and Ruth Roberts. It is played on the radio, during television broadcasts and at Mets' home games. Other songs traditionally sung at Mets home games include \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" and the Sicilian song \"C'\u00e8 la luna mezzo mare\" during the seventh-inning stretch and Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" in the middle of the eigth inning.\nUniform and logo symbolism.\nThe Mets' colors are blue and orange, originally chosen to honor the city's history of National League baseball; blue for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and orange for the New York Giants. Blue and orange are also the colors of New York City, as seen on its flag.\nIn 1998, black was added to the color scheme, although beginning with 2012 the black elements in the uniform began to be phased out, and were eliminated in 2013.\nLogo.\nThe primary logo, designed by sports cartoonist Ray Gotto, consists of \"Mets\" written in orange script trimmed in white across a blue representation of the New York City skyline with a white suspension bridge in the foreground, all contained in an orange circle with orange baseball stitching across the image. Each part of the skyline has special meaning\u2014at the left is a church spire, symbolic of Brooklyn, the borough of churches; the second building from the left is the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Building, the tallest building in Brooklyn at the time of the team's founding; next is the Woolworth Building; after a general skyline view of midtown comes the Empire State Building; at the far right is the headquarters of the United Nations. The suspension bridge in the center symbolizes that the Mets, by bringing National League baseball back to New York, represent all five boroughs; many of New York's major bridges are suspension designs. In 1999, the logo received a slight alteration; a small \"NY\" originally placed to the left of the team script was removed. No other notable changes have ever been made to the logo.\nThe cap logo consists of an orange, interlocking \"NY\" identical to the logo used by the New York Giants in their final years, and is on a blue cap reminiscent of the caps worn by the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nWith the introduction of black as an official color, an alternate team logo was created in 1999. It is identical to the original logo, but the skyline is black instead of blue and the \"Mets\" script is blue trimmed in orange and white instead of orange trimmed in white (the alternate black jerseys displayed the primary blue and orange logo on the left sleeves in 1998; in 1999 this was changed to the alternate black and blue logo). The logo fell into disuse after the Mets dropped the alternate black jerseys and caps in 2012. In 2021, alternate black jerseys returned.\nUniform color and design.\nCurrently, the Mets wear an assortment of uniforms.\nThe home uniforms are white with blue pinstripes and feature \"Mets\" in blue script with an orange outline across the chest, and block letter player names and numbers also in blue with an orange outline. The uniforms are paired with a blue cap featuring an \"NY\" logo in orange, plus blue undersleeves, belts and socks.\nThe gray road jerseys feature a radially-arched \"NEW YORK\" in Tiffany-style letters across the chest, block letter player numerals and names in blue outlined in orange, and blue placket and sleeve piping. Like the home uniforms, the road grays are worn with the same blue caps, undersleeves, belts and socks.\nThe blue alternate uniform, introduced in 2012, features the \"Mets\" script and block lettering and numbers in orange with white outline, and orange piping. The blue alternates are worn with a secondary blue cap featuring the \"NY\" logo in orange trimmed in white.\nThe black alternate uniform, introduced in its current form in 2022, is a modified version of the uniform worn from 1998 to 2012 and reintroduced for Friday home games in 2021. The lettering is blue with white trim and orange drop shadows, lacked the blue piping of the previous iteration, and has the primary logo (sans black) on the left sleeve. The set is worn with an alternate black cap featuring the \"NY\" logo in blue trimmed in white with orange drop shadows. Belts and socks worn with it are also black. Both the blue and black alternate uniforms are worn with plain white pants with blue piping.\nThe Mets' standard blue batting helmet, with the \"NY\" in metallic orange, is currently used for games worn with the primary home, road and blue alternate jerseys. A black alternate helmet is used in games with the black jerseys.\nPlayers of note.\nTeam captains.\nFour players have been team captains for the Mets:\nBaseball Hall of Famers.\n \nRetired numbers.\nThe Mets have retired eight numbers in the history of the franchise.\nMajor League Baseball retired Jackie Robinson's number 42 on April 15, 1997, when the Mets played the Dodgers at Shea Stadium. Butch Huskey wore the number throughout the rest of his Mets career because of a grandfather clause placed on the retired number by MLB. Mo Vaughn also wore 42 during his stint with the Mets, because of the same clause.\nOn the final opening day at Shea Stadium, April 8, 2008, the Mets unveiled a sign bearing the name \"Shea\" next to the team's retired numbers honoring William Shea and his contributions to the franchise.\nIn 2014, a special memorial logo honoring broadcaster Ralph Kiner, depicting a microphone along with his name and the years 1922\u20132014, was displayed on the left-field wall adjacent to, but not as a part of, the Mets' retired numbers, from 2014 to 2016. In the 2016 Mets yearbook, a sidebar in an article on Mike Piazza's upcoming number retirement implies that Kiner has been \"retired\" a la William A. Shea. This was confirmed when the Mets' retired numbers were moved to the roof facade during the 2016 season to accommodate Mike Piazza's number 31; the Kiner logo was placed next to the Shea and Jackie Robinson numbers, no longer separated from the others. On August 28, 2021, Jerry Koosman's No.36 was retired by the Mets. On July 9, 2022, the Mets retired Keith Hernandez's number 17. They retired number 24 worn by Willie Mays on August 27, 2022.\nRivalries.\nSubway Series.\nThe Mets\u00a0\u2013 New York Yankees rivalry is the latest incarnation of the Subway Series, the competition between New York City's teams, the American League New York Yankees and the National League Mets. Until Interleague play started, the two teams had only met in exhibition games. Since the inception of interleague play the two teams have met every regular season since 1997, and since 1999 they have met six times each season, playing two three-game series, one in each team's ballpark. From the 2013 season however the number of games was reduced to four, two at each ballpark with the Mets winning six of the last eight games in that span. They have made the postseason in the same year four times: 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2015, and faced off in the 2000 World Series.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Braves\u2013Mets rivalry is a rivalry between two teams in the National League East, featuring the Atlanta Braves and the Mets.\nAlthough their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the 1969 NLCS, en route to their first World Series championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1990s, when a division realignment in 1994 put the Mets and the Braves in the NL East together (from 1969 to 1993, the Braves were in the NL West). The two teams faced each other again in the 1999 NLCS, and the Braves won the series four games to two. However, they would go on to lose to the Yankees in the 1999 World Series.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nThe rivalry between the Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies from 2006 to 2008 was said to be among the \"hottest\" rivalries in the National League.\nAside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season, as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the teams have battled for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 and contended in 2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011. The Phillies' 2007 Eastern Division Title was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining while losing 12 of 18 games that season to the Phillies, including being swept at home in the first 3 games of the remaining 17, dropping their lead from 7 games to 3.5.\nNew York Mets Foundation.\nA registered 501(c)(3) charity, the New York Mets Foundation is the philanthropic organization of the New York Mets. Founded in 1963, it funds and promotes charitable causes in the Mets community. One of these causes is Tuesday's Children, is a non-profit family service organization that \"has made a long term commitment to meet the needs of every family who lost a loved one in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001\". The Mets host the annual Welcome Home Dinner, which raised over $550,000 for the Mets Foundation in 2012. All proceeds were distributed to Katz Institute for Women's Health and Katz Women's Hospitals of North Shore-LIJ Health System and The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.\nNew York Mets broadcasters.\nTelevision.\nMost Mets games are carried by SportsNet New York (SNY), a joint venture of the Mets and NBC Sports Regional Networks. The team's terrestrial broadcast home is WPIX, where the team has broadcast games since 1999.\nLongtime Mets radio announcer Gary Cohen does the play-by-play, having moved to television with the launch of SNY in 2006. Former Mets Keith Hernandez and Ron Darling are the color commentators with Steve Gelbs being the on-the-field reporter.\nIn early January 2016, Keith Hernandez re-signed with SNY. Reports indicate that Hernandez received a raise and three-year contract.\nRadio.\nSince 2019, Mets games have been broadcast on WCBS-AM 880. Howie Rose is the main play-by-play announcer; Wayne Randazzo, who previously hosted the pre- and post-game shows, is Rose's partner. Longtime Mets beat reporter Ed Coleman took over the pre- and post-game role for most games.\nThe Mets' previous radio flagship was WOR-AM from 2014 to 2018. The Mets were previously carried by WFAN-AM, which inherited the team's broadcast rights from WHN when it took over its frequency in 1987, and in later years by WFAN-FM which simulcasts the AM signal.\nSpanish-language broadcasts are carried by WEPN 1050 AM featuring Juan Alicea and Max Perez-Jimenez. It was formerly broadcast on WQBU-FM 92.7, Que Buena from 2020 to 2021. Both English and Spanish broadcasts are also aired on the Audacy internet radio service.\nRose, who has spent much of his career covering the Mets, replaced Bob Murphy as Gary Cohen's broadcast partner in 2004 following Murphy's retirement. Cohen then left the radio booth for the SNY television booth in 2006 and was replaced by Tom McCarthy, who departed after two seasons and was replaced by Wayne Hagin. Josh Lewin joined the broadcast after the team parted ways with Hagin following the 2011 season; he departed when broadcasts moved to WCBS.\nCoinciding with the move to WCBS, the Mets, abruptly and without public announcement (other than a brief e-mail to its affiliates days before the season began), stopped syndicating its games to other stations outside the New York City area, shutting down the New York Mets Radio Network.\nMinor league affiliations.\nThe New York Mets farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates."}

The term Mother Goose rhymes is interchangeable with nursery rhymes.\nFrom the mid-16th century nursery rhymes begin to be recorded in English plays, and most popular rhymes date from the 17th and 18th centuries. The first English collections, \"Tommy Thumb's Song Book\" and a sequel, \"Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book\", were published by Mary Cooper in 1744. Publisher John Newbery's stepson, Thomas Carnan, was the first to use the term Mother Goose for nursery rhymes when he published a compilation of English rhymes, \"Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle\" (London, 1780).\nHistory.\nLullabies.\nThe oldest children's songs of which we have records are lullabies, intended to help a child fall asleep. Lullabies can be found in every human culture. The English term lullaby is thought to come from \"lu, lu\" or \"la la\" sounds made by mothers or nurses to calm children, and \"\" or \"bye bye\", either another lulling sound or a term for good night. Until the modern era lullabies were usually recorded only incidentally in written sources. The Roman nurses' lullaby, \"Lalla, Lalla, Lalla, aut dormi, aut lacta\", is recorded in a scholium on Persius and may be the oldest to survive.\nMany medieval English verses associated with the birth of Jesus take the form of a lullaby, including \"Lullay, my liking, my dere son, my sweting\" and may be versions of contemporary lullabies. However, most of those used today date from the 17th century. For example, a well known lullaby such as \"Rock-a-bye, baby on a tree top\", cannot be found in records until the late-18th century when it was printed by John Newbery (c.\u00a01765).\nEarly nursery rhymes.\nA French poem, similar to \"Thirty days hath September\", numbering the days of the month, was recorded in the 13th century. From the later Middle Ages there are records of short children's rhyming songs, often as marginalia. From the mid-16th century they begin to be recorded in English plays. \"Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man\" is one of the oldest surviving English nursery rhymes. The earliest recorded version of the rhyme appears in Thomas d'Urfey's play \"The Campaigners\" from 1698. Most nursery rhymes were not written down until the 18th century, when the publishing of children's books began to move from polemic and education towards entertainment, but there is evidence for many rhymes existing before this, including \"To market, to market\" and \"Cock a doodle doo\", which date from at least the late 16th century. Nursery rhymes with 17th century origins include, \"Jack Sprat\" (1639), \"The Grand Old Duke of York\" (1642), \"Lavender's Blue\" (1672) and \"Rain Rain Go Away\" (1687).\nThe first English collections, \"Tommy Thumb's Song Book\" and a sequel, \"Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book\", were published by Mary Cooper in London in 1744, with such songs becoming known as 'Tommy Thumb's songs'. A copy of the latter is held in the British Library. John Newbery's stepson, Thomas Carnan, was the first to use the term Mother Goose for nursery rhymes when he published a compilation of English rhymes, \"Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle\" (London, 1780). These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of Mummers' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. One example of a nursery rhyme in the form a riddle is \"As I was going to St Ives\", which dates to 1730. About half of the currently recognised \"traditional\" English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century. More English rhymes were collected by Joseph Ritson in \"Gammer Gurton's Garland or The Nursery Parnassus\" (1784), published in London by Joseph Johnson.\n19th century.\nIn the early 19th century printed collections of rhymes began to spread to other countries, including Robert Chambers's \"Popular Rhymes of Scotland\" (1826) and in the United States, \"Mother Goose's Melodies\" (1833). From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes\u2014for instance, in \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" which combines the melody of an 18th-century French tune \"Ah vous dirai-je, Maman\" with a 19th-century English poem by Jane Taylor entitled \"The Star\" used as lyrics.\nEarly folk song collectors also often collected (what are now known as) nursery rhymes, including in Scotland Sir Walter Scott and in Germany Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim in \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\" (1806\u20131808). The first, and possibly the most important academic collection to focus in this area was James Orchard Halliwell's \"The Nursery Rhymes of England\" (1842) and \"Popular Rhymes and Tales\" in 1849, in which he divided rhymes into antiquities (historical), fireside stories, game-rhymes, alphabet-rhymes, riddles, nature-rhymes, places and families, proverbs, superstitions, customs, and nursery songs (lullabies). By the time of Sabine Baring-Gould's \"A Book of Nursery Songs\" (1895), folklore was an academic study, full of comments and footnotes. A professional anthropologist, Andrew Lang (1844\u20131912) produced \"The Nursery Rhyme Book\" in 1897.\n20th century.\nThe early years of the 20th century are notable for the illustrations to children's books including Randolph Caldecott's \"Hey Diddle Diddle Picture Book\" (1909) and Arthur Rackham's \"Mother Goose\" (1913). The definitive study of English rhymes remains the work of Iona and Peter Opie.\nMeanings of nursery rhymes.\nMany nursery rhymes have been argued to have hidden meanings and origins. John Bellenden Ker (1765\u20131842), for example, wrote four volumes arguing that English nursery rhymes were actually written in 'Low Saxon', a hypothetical early form of Dutch. He then 'translated' them back into English, revealing in particular a strong tendency to anti-clericalism. Many of the ideas about the links between rhymes and historical persons, or events, can be traced back to Katherine Elwes's book \"The Real Personages of Mother Goose\" (1930), in which she linked famous nursery-rhyme characters with real people, on little or no evidence. She posited that children's songs were a peculiar form of coded historical narrative, propaganda or covert protest, and did not believe that they were written simply for entertainment.\nNursery rhyme revisionism.\nThere have been several attempts, across the world, to revise nursery rhymes (along with fairy tales and popular songs). As recently as the late 18th century, rhymes like \"Little Robin Redbreast\" were occasionally cleaned up for a young audience. In the late 19th century the major concern seems to have been violence and crime, which led some children's publishers in the United States like Jacob Abbot and Samuel Goodrich to change Mother Goose rhymes.\nIn the early and mid-20th centuries this was a form of bowdlerisation, concerned with some of the more violent elements of nursery rhymes and led to the formation of organisations like the British 'Society for Nursery Rhyme Reform'. Psychoanalysts such as Bruno Bettelheim strongly criticized this revisionism, on the grounds that it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues and it has been argued that revised versions may not perform the functions of catharsis for children, or allow them to imaginatively deal with violence and danger.\nIn the late 20th century revisionism of nursery rhymes became associated with the idea of political correctness. Most attempts to reform nursery rhymes on this basis appear to be either very small scale, light-hearted updating, like Felix Dennis's \"When Jack Sued Jill \u2013 Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times\" (2006), or satires written as if from the point of view of political correctness in order to condemn reform. The controversy in Britain in 1986 over changing the language of \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\" because, it was alleged in the popular press, it was seen as racially dubious, was apparently based only on a rewriting of the rhyme in one private nursery, as an exercise for the children.\nNursery rhymes and education.\nIt has been argued that nursery rhymes set to music aid in a child's development. In the German \"Kniereitvers\", the child is put in mock peril, but the experience is a pleasurable one of care and support, which over time the child comes to command for itself. Research also supports the assertion that music and rhyme increase a child's ability in spatial reasoning, which aid mathematics skills.\nCitations.\nSources"}

It has a satellite office in Los Angeles. It was founded by Matt Black and Jonathan More (better known as Coldcut) and managed by Peter Quicke and others.\nInspired by a visit to Japan, Black and More created Ninja Tune in 1990 as a means to escape the creative control of major labels, and as a vehicle to release music of an underground nature, free from the constraints they experienced in their brief stints with Arista and Big Life. The label has been called \"visionary\" and \"reliably excellent\". It has signed a diverse range of artists, has created its own publishing company, Just Isn't Music, and finds innovative uses of software.\nThe label's first releases \u2014 the first five volumes of DJ Food's \"Jazz Brakes\" \u2014 were produced by Coldcut in the early 1990s, and were celebrated by the music press and beat aficionados. They were composed of instrumental sample-based cuts that led the duo to help pioneer new instrumental hip hop beats genres (alongside the Mo'Wax label and Ninja Tune artists such as Funki Porcini, The Herbaliser and DJ Vadim) and, to this day, are recognized as being indispensable tools for DJs.\nThe label has since released music of many artists (including The Cinematic Orchestra, Amon Tobin, Bonobo, Kelis, BICEP, The Bug, Machinedrum, Lee Bannon) and distributes for other record labels \u2013 including Big Dada, Brainfeeder (Flying Lotus' label) and Technicolour Records.\nHistory.\n1990\u20131999.\nFollowing a Coldcut tour in Japan with Norman Cook, a.k.a. Fatboy Slim, then of Beats International, the label lifted its moniker and aesthetic from the Japanese TV shows of the 1950s and 1960s based on the Ninja. With their first releases in the early 1990s, Ninja Tune went on to, according to Pitchfork, \"usher in trip-hop/instrumental hip hop\".\nAfter Coldcut's success with their first label, \"Ahead of Our Time\", contractual issues prevented them from releasing anything under their own name. Ninja Tune's inaugural release was Coldcut's (under the name Bogus Order) house break collection \"Zen Brakes Vol. 1\" in 1990. The label got a bigger name for itself when Coldcut, as DJ Food, released their funky hip hop jazz-breaks album, \"Jazz Brakes Vol. 1\", which, according to \"Record Collector\", \"blew up\" in the DJ circuit. DJ Food's \"Jazz Brakes\" series were intended as source material for DJs and producers who worked with breaks and beats.\nIn 1992, Peter Quicke joined as label manager, as did Patrick Carpenter, a.k.a. PC, who joined Coldcut as sound engineer. PC would become a crucial member of Ninja Tune, and from \"Jazz Brakes Vol. 4\" onward, an integral part of the DJ Food production team. Steinski, a big inspiration behind Coldcut's initial forays into music, released his first Ninja Tune EP as Steinski and Mass Media in the same year. The single, in the words of Pitchfork, \"builds on a catchy loop of the Jackson 5's 'It's Great to Be Here' and creates one of the few anti-Gulf War protest songs of the era, transforming [ U.S. President George H. W. ] Bush's speech into a pop hook ('Regrettably, we now believe/ That only force will make him leave') and interspersing quotes from Jello Biafra ('don't hate the media, become the media!') and Mario Savio's famous 1964 address to the Berkeley Free Speech Movement\".\nBetween 1994 and 1997 Ninja explored and defined the instrumental hip hop beats sound further (often known as trip hop). Its pioneering influence on the genre became more prevalent with the label's first compilation, \"Funkjazztical Tricknology\", in 1995. The genre originated in England as a successor to acid house, taking in acid jazz and funk, and using hip hop style breakbeats rather than the mechanical '4 on the floor' drum rhythm of house. Ninja artists especially looked beyond the normal sampling sources of old funk records into jazz, epitomised by Ninja act The Cinematic Orchestra.\nColdcut's contribution to Britain's flourishing scene was solidified by their Solid Steel show on London's Kiss FM, on airwaves since 1988. The ongoing success of Solid Steel, and its subsequent syndication across the globe, broadcast the Ninja brand across the airwaves. The late night Saturday show cut all manner of beats, samples and loops into a chaotic musical blend. The show's 'everything but the kitchen sink' approach continued through Coldcut's \"utterly brilliant\" \"Journeys by DJ\" series of mix compilations in 1995. The title \"70 Minutes of Madness\" was a nod to Coldcut's earlier Eric B &amp; Rakim remix, and included sounds from Depth Charge, DJ Food, Plastikman, Mantronix, Harold Budd and the Doctor Who theme.\nIn 1994, Matt Black's close friend Mixmaster Morris introduced Matt to Openmind \u2013 a DJ &amp; design collective in Camberwell \u2013 at the Telepathic Fish chill-out club they were running. Openmind included Kevin Foakes a.k.a. Strictly Kev of DJ Food. After submitting a re-styled company logo he was employed by Ninja Tune in the capacity of overall design consultant. Matt Black also invited Foakes to Ninja's recording studio, where he eventually joined the many hands at work on DJ Food's 1995 album, \"Recipe for Disaster\" (which also included Patrick Carpenter a.k.a. PC, Isaac Elliston, Paul Rabiger and Paul Brooks). The album was called a \"whirlwind of beats put through the blender\" and proved a good cross-selection of the group's various styles.\nIn 1995, The Herbaliser, one of the more purely hip-hop oriented acts on Ninja Tune's roster at that point released their debut album \"Remedies\". \"Remedies\" brought both the group and the label much attention.\nAlso in 1995, an album launch party for DJ Food's \"Recipe for Disaster\" was the beginning of what would become a regular club night, Stealth. Stealth was named Club of the Year by NME in 1996, with guests including Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister, Squarepusher, Ashley Beedle, James Lavelle, Kid Koala and the label roster. Around the same time, Ninja Tune began organizing its first package tours across the UK and Europe.\nWith their two 1994 albums, \"Paradise Blown\" and \"Electric Lazyland\", 9 Lazy 9 helped spawn the funky, subterranean sound for which Ninja Tune would earn its early acclaim, combining hip hop and funk breakbeats with jazz-influenced sound. Their success inspired one half of the Italian-based duo, James Braddell, to return to the UK and begin his own solo project. As Funki Porcini, Braddell released \"Hed Phone Sex\" in 1995, which ran through a gamut of genres, from dub to drum and bass. Braddell continued to explore sonic territories on 1996's \"Let's See What Carmen Can Do\" EP and the \"Love, Pussycats and Car Wrecks\" album from the same year.\nDJ Vadim, a Russian born turntablist from London, who'd already released EPs on his own Jazz Fudge label, further expanded the vocabulary of instrumental hip hop with his 1996 album \"U.S.S.R. Repertoire\", bringing \"locked grooves and ultra-vivid, up-close sample-textures\". \"U.S.S.R. Reconstruction\" followed in 1998, a remix album filled with hip hop that The Wire claimed \"turns the air into molasses\". With \"U.S.S.R. Reconstruction\", Vadim selected a baker's dozen of likeminded producers, including Reflection, Clatterbox. DJ Krush, Silent Poets and Kid Koala, creating an album that flows without a hitch through the darkest hip hop and beat exploration.\nThroughout the 1990s, Matt Black began exploring his own interests in burgeoning computer and audio/visual technologies, to experiment with the VJ software and hardware that was already changing the Coldcut DJ performances. His Hex collective \u2013 also featuring artist Robert Pepperell and programmer Miles Visman \u2013 produced video games and multimedia CD-ROMs in the early 1990s, along with subsequent projects that further affirmed Ninja Tune's alliance with A/V disciples. Teaming up with Hexstatic member Stuart Warren-Hill (who also signed to the Ntone label for several audio visual albums), Coldcut's \"Timber\" video \u2013 an AV collage piece using analogous techniques to audio sample collage \u2013 was put on heavy rotation on MTV, and won awards for its innovative use of repetitive video clips synced to the music, including being shortlisted at the Edinburgh Television and Film Festival in their top five music videos of the year in 1998.\nIn 1995, Matt Black created \"Pipe\", Ninja's first website. The label's current website ninjatune.net was developed by the following year.\nAlso in 1996, Ninja Tune expanded across the ocean, opening its Montreal office to manage distribution across North America. That same year, Ninja Tune cemented its place with the double-disc \"Flexistentialism\", a rare compilation that featured the label's growing roster, including DJ Food, Funki Porcini, The Herbaliser, Luke Vibert, Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister and DJ Vadim, among others. With \"Flexistentialism\", Ninja was described as devising \"a term that perfectly expresses the antitheses between chaos and order\"\nAmon Tobin, meanwhile, was building groundbreaking drum and bass from 1950s big band drum battles. His 1997 Ninja Tune debut, \"Bricolage\", contains influences from drum and bass, hip hop, blues, jazz and samba, all digitally processed to create a sense of the bricolage suggested by the title. The album proved a strong seller, especially in America, where Pitchfork awarded the album a perfect 10.0. The following year's immensely complex album, \"Permutation\", saw Tobin creating electronic experimentation that retools d'n'b's basic structures to a practically surreal extent.\nIn 1997 Stealth finished at the Blue Note (in Hoxton), and Ninja Tune's sister label Big Dada was launched. Coldcut's fourth album \"Let Us Play!\" was released in September 1997, making its way to the Top 40, reaching No. 33 in the UK Charts. \"Let Us Play!\" paid homage to the greats that inspired them. Their first album to be released on Ninja Tune, it featured guest appearances by Grandmaster Flash, Steinski, Jello Biafra, Jimpster, The Herbaliser, Talvin Singh, Daniel Pemberton and Selena Saliva. Coldcut's cut 'n' paste method on the album was compared to that of Dadaism and William S. Burroughs. Hex collaborated with Coldcut to produce the multimedia CD-ROM for the album. Hex later evolved the software into the engine that was used on the \"Let Us Play!\" world tour.\nIn 1999, \"Let Us Replay!\" was released, a double-disc remix album where Coldcut's classic tunes were remixed by Cornelius (the opener of the album, which was heralded as a highlight of the album), Irresistible Force, Shut Up and Dance, Carl Craig and J Swinscoe. \"Spin Magazine\" stated that \"Let Us Replay!\" pieces together \"short sharp shocks that put the mental in 'experimental' and still bring the breaks till the breakadawn\". It also includes a few live tracks from the duo's innovative world tour. The CD-ROM of the album, which also contained a free demo disc of the VJamm software, was one of the earliest audiovisual CD- Roms on the market, and Muzik claimed deserved to \"have them canonized...it's like buying an entire mini studio for under $15\".\nIn March 1999, Big Dada introduced Rodney Smith, a.k.a. Roots Manuva. \"Brand New Second Hand\" was, in the words of AllMusic, \"a bright moment for British rap, the debut album from Roots Manuva introduced a hip hop chameleon boasting dark productions and a distinct style, plus much more to say than most rappers\". He soon became heralded for his unique delivery, which Pitchfork claimed one of the \"addictive, compelling, and, above all, heartfelt\".\nHaving worked as an intern in the Ninja Tune office in the mid 1990s, Jason Swinscoe became an instrumental part of the team, and by 1998 he released his first 12\" as The Cinematic Orchestra, \"Diabolus\", shortly followed by the full length \"Motion\". The surprise hit album landed somewhere between jazz and electronica and gathered samples from unlikely sources. That same year, Swinscoe began performing live with an expanded line-up, featuring Federico Ughi on drums, Alex James on piano and DJ Food's Patrick Carpenter on turntables.\nMr. Scruff's \"Keep It Unreal\" was released in the summer of 1999. Filled with bubbly breakbeats, slick horn sizzles and bristling house beats, the album opened with BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Ann Hobbes asking, \"Are you ready Mr. Scruff?\"\nAt some point in 1999, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided that DJ Vadim and Sarah Jones' pro-women empowerment record \"Your Revolution\" was \"indecent\" for radio. The decision ended up in court in 2002, where arguments were advanced for freedom of speech, freedom of expression and to argue the double standards of the ban and fine.\n2000\u20132010.\nIn 2000, Ninja Tune celebrated its first decade of music with \"Xen Cuts\", a three CD, 6 x LP box set that provided a collection of their artists. The mostly downtempo affair featured the likes of Latyrx (Lyrics Born and Lateef), The Herbaliser, Kid Koala and Luke Vibert, Clifford Gilberto, Amon Tobin and Funki Porcini.\nAlso in 2000, Kid Koala released \"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\", \"a playfully arranged montage of quirky sound bites, rhythmic scratching and fluid hip hop beats\". Relying as heavily upon comedy albums and sound effects records as jazz and funk vinyl for sample material, the release, which was called brilliant and humorous received much critical success. Kid Koala cut two further highly acclaimed albums for Ninja, 2003's \"Some of My Best Friends Are DJs\" and 2006's \"Your Mom's Favorite DJ\".\nIn 2001, Roots Manuva delivered his second album, \"Run Come Save Me\", which was deemed one of the albums of the year by \"The Independent\", and \"not just a landmark UK hip hop album, but a landmark hip hop album period\" by Mojo. The album charted at number 33 in the UK Charts. \"Witness (1 Hope)\", the first single off the album, charted at No. 45, and was declared by AllMusic as being \"the best British rap single since Tricky's 'Aftermath'\". \"Run Come Save Me\" won a nomination for the 2002 Mercury Music Award, and was called by \"The Times\" \"Too maverick, too brilliantly original a talent to be tethered by mere genre or geography.\"\nAlso in 2001 Cornwall's Luke Vibert joined Ninja Tune. Growing up amongst contemporaries Aphex Twin and Tom Middleton/Global Communication, Vibert had made a name for himself in experimental electronica, though his name has always been hard to pin down: he operates under several different aliases. With the moniker Wagon Christ, Vibert released \"Musipal\" on Ninja, which \"NME\" called \"an intriguing procession of cheeky collages\".\nMr. Scruff's second album on Ninja Tune, \"Trouser Jazz\", was released on 9 September 2002. It charted at 29 on the UK Chart.\nIn 2003, Simon Green, a.k.a. Bonobo, released his first proper Ninja album, \"Dial 'M' for Monkey\", a subliminally seductive collection of atmospheric instrumentals. A live version of Bonobo soon took to the road, which seeped into the production of 2006's \"Days to Come,\" an album that blurs the line between a programmed and live sound and created \"a daydream vibe embedded within its moodiness\".\nBlurring lines further, Coldcut collaborated with American video mashup artist TV Sheriff in 2004 to produce their cut-up entitled \"Revolution USA\". The tactical-media project (coordinated with Canadian art duo NomIg) followed on from the UK version and extended the premise \"into an open access participatory project\". Through the multimedia political art project, over 12 gigabytes of footage from the last 40 years of US politics were made accessible to download, allowing participants to create a cut-up over a Coldcut beat. Coldcut also collaborated with TV Sheriff and NomIg to produce two audiovisual pieces \"World of Evil\" (2004) and \"Revolution '08\" (2008), both composed of footage from the United States presidential elections of respective years. The music used was composed by Coldcut, with \"Revolution '08\" featuring a remix by The Qemists.\nRoots Manuva climbed back into the limelight at the beginning of 2005, with his deft album \"Awfully Deep\". His third album, which reached number 24 in the UK Charts, was celebrated by critics for his growth as an artist, with \"NME\" calling it \"a set of immense maturity that never rubs your nose in its thematic complexity, compositional innovation and thunderous thump-beats\".\nThe Cinematic Orchestra scored a new soundtrack, Man with a Movie Camera, for a screening of the visionary 1929 Russian silent feature, \"Man with a Movie Camera\", for the 2000 Portuguese Film Festival Fantasporto. The following year it was performed at the opening gala of Portugal's year as European Capital of Culture in Porto in front of 3000 people. The material written for this film score laid the groundwork for what would be The Cinematic Orchestra's second full-length, \"Every Day\", released in May 2002, and one of Ninja's best-selling albums. Roots Manuva featured on the track \"All Things to All Men\", which later soundtracked the final scenes of 2006 movie \"Kidulthood\". The Cinematic Orchestra's albums grew increasingly ambitious over the years, with 2007's \"Ma Fleur\" album marking a move away from beats, and embracing folk influences. The album was based on the work of photographer Maya Hayuk (who commissioned 11 pictures based on three short stories recounting the journey from birth to death), and conceived by Swinscoe as the premise for the score of an imaginary film. Album track \"To Build a Home\" became one of Ninja's top tracks of all time (with its fan video clocking up nearly 9 million plays), and track \"TBAH\" features vocals from Patrick Watson, which became the band's most successful song.\nFollowing Jason Swinscoe's vocal appreciation of Jaga Jazzist's 2001 album \"A Livingroom Hush\", the Norwegian jazz band signed to Ninja Tune to re-release \"A Livingroom Hush\" in 2002, followed by \"The Stix\" later that year, and their fourth album \"What We Must\" in 2005.\nColdcut returned with the single \"Everything Is Under Control\" at the end of 2005, featuring Jon Spencer (of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion) and Mike Ladd. It was followed in 2006 by their fifth studio album \"Sound Mirrors\", which was quoted as being \"one of the most vital and imaginative records Jon More and Matt Black have ever made\", and saw the duo \"continue, impressively, to find new ways to present political statements through a gamut of pristine electronics and breakbeats\". The fascinating array of guest vocalists included Soweto Kinch, Annette Peacock, Amiri Baraka, and Saul Williams.\nNinja hooked up with L.A. filmmaker and photographer B+, who had filmed \"Keepintime: Talking Drums Whispering Vinyl\", a short movie documenting a meeting between jazz/funk drummers Paul Humphrey and James Gadson, and a bunch of turntablists who now scratched and sampled their breakbeats, including DJ Shadow, Cut Chemist and the Beat Junkies. This project snowballed into a live concert featuring the drum duo jamming along with the turntablists \u2013 and included extra guests Madlib and DJ Numark. In 2005, Ninja released \"Keep in Time: A Live Recording\", a CD/DVD package that included remixes from King Britt, Oh No, J Rocc and AmmonContact.\nBack in London, having previously scored a place with his college band E.V.A. on the 1996 Ninja 12\" \"One Track Mind\", Fin Greenall subsequently signed to the label as a solo artist, under the name Fink. First releasing \"Fresh Produce\" \u2013 an atmospheric set of downtempo instrumental hip hop tracks \u2013 on sister label Ntone in 2000, it was 2006's \"Biscuits for Breakfast\" album that set Fink officially on Ninja Tune. And it set him far apart from the rest of the label, going his own way to become a full-blown, guitar picking singer-songwriter. Two subsequent full lengths \u2013 2007's \"Distance and Time\" and 2009's \"Sort of Revolution\" (which featured song-writing collaborations with John Legend) have seen Fink further develop this new sound.\nOn the topic of sound, noise manipulator Amon Tobin came back around at the beginning of 2007 with \"Foley Room\", his sixth studio album, and a long player that was called his \"darkest work yet\". Tobin was inspired by the work of foley artists: a foley room is where the sound effects are recorded for films; foley artists use their imagination and ingenuity to make the right noise for the situation they are presented with. Amon and a team of assistants headed out into the streets with high sensitivity microphones and recorded found sounds from tigers roaring to cats eating rats, from wasps to falling chickpeas, kitchen utensils to motorbikes to water dripping from a tap. Added to this were the sounds of The Kronos Quartet, Stefan Schneider (of To Rococo Rot) and Sarah Pag\u00e9, Tobin travelling from foley rooms in Montreal to San Francisco to Seattle and back as he collected them (the CD release is accompanied by a short DVD, \"Foley Room: Found Footage\", documenting the recording process).\nKevin Martin began developing his own sound further as The Bug, after other projects as GOD, Techno Animal, Ice and Curse of the Golden Vampire. The Bug's second album in 2003, \"Pressure\", demonstrated a fully formed aesthetic \u2013 stark spaces, gleefully subsonic bass \u2013 holding collaborations with vocalists such as Toastie Taylor, Wayne Lonesome and Daddy Freddy. 2008's \"London Zoo\", meanwhile, was The Bug's third album \u2013 and first for Ninja Tune. Recorded over three years with its maker living in his studio, without a kitchen or shower, the album included collaborations with Warrior Queen, Tippa Irie, Burial, Kode9 collaborator Spaceape, and even singer-toaster Ricky Ranking showing up on three tracks. The multivocal, spoken-sung, collaborative album has enjoyed recent cult success, appearing in many outlets' Best of 2008 lists.\nThe year 2008 launched Ninja Tune's \"You Don't Know\", their sixth official label sampler, and, like its predecessors, contained high quality picks from their major releases, with select remixes and a few rarities. While 2007's \"Well Deep\" multimedia package shed light on Big Dada, Ninja Cuts drew a healthy cross-section from all three Ninja associated labels.\n2008 also marked Daedelus' first official Ninja album, \"Love to Make Music To\", after his previous albums \"Exquisite Corpse\" and \"Denies the Day's Demise\" had been licensed by Ninja Tune. The album showcased the L.A. artist's diverse nature and his skills as a multi-instrumentalist as well as his engrossing stylistic shifts. Additionally that year (a year after their 2007 \"Stompbox\" 12\"), The Qemists released their debut album, \"Join the Q.\" Known to construct some of the most energetic breakbeats of the late 2000s, the vinyl version of the album comes as four super-heavy platters, weighing nearly a kilogram.\nIn 2008, an international group of party organisers, activists and artists \u2013 including Coldcut \u2013 received a grant from the Intelligent Energy Department of the European Union, to create a project that promoted intelligent energy and environmental awareness to the youth of Europe. The result was \"Energy Union\", a piece of VJ cinema, political campaign, music tour, party, art exhibition and social media hub. \"Energy Union\" toured 12 EU countries throughout 2009 and 2010, completing 24 events in total. Coldcut created the \"Energy Union\" show for the tour, a one-hour Audio/Visual montage on the theme of Intelligent Energy. In presenting new ideas for climate, environmental and energy communication strategies, the \"Energy Union\" tour was well received, and reached a widespread audience in cities across the UK, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain and the Czech Republic.\nSpeech Debelle's debut album, 2009's \"Speech Therapy\", finally scored Big Dada a Mercury Prize, after prior nominations for Roots Manuva's \"Run Come Save Me\" and Ty's \"Upwards\". With the album, NME called her: \"one to seriously watch\".\n2010\u2013present.\nIn 2010, Ninja Tune celebrated 20 years of releasing music. A book entitled Ninja Tune: \"20 Years of Beats and Pieces\" was released on 12 August 2010, and an exhibition was held at Black Dog Publishing's Black Dog Space in London showcasing artwork, design and photography from the label's 20-year history. A \"stunning futurespective\" compilation album was released on 20 September in two formats \u2013 a regular version consisting of two 2-disc volumes, and a limited edition (of 3,500 copies), containing six CDs, six 7\" vinyl singles, a hardback copy of the book, a poster and additional items. It featured new music from Amon Tobin (also as Two Fingers), Roots Manuva, The Cinematic Orchestra, Kid Koala, Mr Scruff, The Bug, King Geedorah, Zomby, Bonobo, Toddla T, Daedelus, Dorian Concept, Floating Points, Wagon Christ, cLOUDDEAD and many others. It also included new remixes from Switch, Autechre, Benga, Cut Chemist, Modeselektor, Roots Manuva, Diplo, Gold Panda, Mark Pritchard, Rustie, Prefuse 73, 808 State, Joe Goddard, King Jammy, The Orb, Micachu, Gaslamp Killer, Kronos Quartet, Mala, El-P (and El-B) and many more. In The Independent's \"Album of the Week\" review, the compilation was deemed \"a glorious celebration of Ninja Tune's audio splendour\".\nAs part of the 20th anniversary, Ninja Tune produced 20 different events around the world. Ninja Tune sold out Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Cinematic Orchestra, Amon Tobin and Dorian Concept all presenting a one-off orchestral performance with the London Metropolitan Orchestra arranged by composer Ilan Eshkeri. For a separate London event, Ninja also placed a legendary rave in 3 rooms in a car park behind the Tate Modern with all of their artists in one place for first time (artists included Coldcut, Mr Scruff, Roots Manuva, Toddla T, The Bug, Daedelus, Kid Koala, Bonobo, Dj Food + DK, Mark Pritchard, DJ Kentaro, Dorian Concept, XXXchange (Spank Rock), DELS, Floating Points, Jammer, Dark Sky and Offshore). For the Ninja XX gig in New York, the label's venue (Santos Party House) was shut down unexpectedly, moving the event at the last minute to the Bowery (CITATION: Brooklyn Vegan, 28 October 2010).\nIn October 2011, Ninja Tune's massive \"Ninja Tune XX\" campaign won \"Innovative Marketing Campaign of the Year\" at the 2011 AIM Awards.\nIt was around this time that Ninja Tune began expanding its roster in an interesting new direction, co-signing underground labels with whom they felt artistically aligned. In February 2010, LA-based producer Flying Lotus, a.k.a. Steven Ellison, announced his Brainfeeder imprint had struck up a partnership for Ninja Tune to handle manufacturing, marketing and distribution for Brainfeeder everywhere outside the US. In April 2010, Sheffield-born producer and DJ Toddla T (who'd originally arrived at Ninja having produced parts of Roots Manuva's 2008 album, \"Slime &amp; Reason\", which reached number 22 in the UK Charts) also signed his Girls Music record label to Ninja Tune for distribution, manufacturing and marketing, in addition to signing a three-album deal. In June 2012, Ninja announced a partnership with underground artist Actress and his Werkdiscs imprint, home to Zomby's \"Where Were U in 92?\", Actress's \"Hazyville\", and various records by Lukid and Lone.\nAlso in 2010, Bonobo's own \"Black Sands\" album marked his fourth full-length. It pushed Bonobo's sound \"much more steeped in beat-making, creating deluxe, post-dance soundscapes\", and achieved worldwide commercial success. In February 2012, Ninja followed up with a remix album, \"Black Sands Remixed\", which featured re-imaginings from producers such as Lapalux, Mark Pritchard, Machinedrum and FaltyDL.\nA couple months before, in November 2011, New York producer FaltyDL had made his debut on the Ninja roster with his \"Atlantis\" EP, a \"smoother and shufflier\" ride than most of his earlier work. His work for Ninja was deemed \"calm and focused, a trend that continued on his third album\", \"Hardcourage\", released in January 2012. The album was \"sure-footed and big-hearted, accessible and yet cerebral\".\nJaga Jazzist returned in 2010 with their strongest release to date, \"One-Armed Bandit\", which featured new members within Jaga Jazzist's ranks and included \"tropical polyrhythms, modernist patterns, and even techno-inspired synth sequences\".\nAnother release that pushed Ninja to new sonic territories came from London-based artist Floating Points at the end of 2010 with 'Post Suite / Almost in Profile'. The Floating Points Ensemble is an instrumental ensemble headed by himself on Fender Rhodes and Sequential Circuits Pro One and Prophet keyboards. The double A-side 10\" vinyl single featured two tracks by the full Ensemble, recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios for the Ninja Tune XX twentieth anniversary celebration.\nIn 2010, a sound designer from Berlin (by way of Bristol), Emika, brought a new sound to the label, with her melodic, R&amp;B tinged bass-heavy 'Double Edge.' Her self-titled debut was later released in 2011, bridging the \"minimalist menace of Bristol dubstep to breathy accessible vocals and classical piano\". On her 2013 follow-up, 'DVA,' Emika beefed up her songwriting, focusing on political and personal themes.\nIn March 2011, another exploratory bass cadet \u2013 Dorian Concept \u2013 released his first Ninja EP, \"Her Tears Taste Like Pears\". It proved to be a \"solid example of the kind of genius Concept, himself something of a child piano prodigy, is capable of\".\nThe following May saw the release of a much-awaited album from Amon Tobin, \"ISAM\", which set a new benchmark for live electronic music. Tobin decided to step away from previous DJ centric performances, and instead provided a large-scale live audio/visual experience to select cities around the world. Developed alongside V Squared Labs, Leviathan, Vello Virkhaus &amp; Matt Daly, Alex Lazarus, Vitamotus Design Studio, and Stefano Novelli, the show featured a 25' x 14' x 8' multi-dimensional/ shape shifting 3D art installation surrounding Tobin and enveloping him and the audience in a 3D experience. Tobin conceptualized the show as a projection mapped \"visual score\" to the music from \"ISAM\". The show completed a sold-out 15-show run through US and Canada, in addition to five sold out UK/EU shows. In 2012, ISAM Live returned with a larger tour, starting at Coachella and traveling to Sydney Opera House, London's Brixton Academy, New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, Greek Theatre (Los Angeles), Sonar (Barcelona), as well as full European and US tours throughout summer and fall. In May 2012, Ninja Tune released an Amon Tobin box set (7 \u00d7 CD, 2 \u00d7 DVD, 6 \u00d7 Vinyl, 10\").\nAt the beginning of 2012, Speech Debelle returned to Big Dada, after much critical speculation about leaving the label. She returned from her Mercury Prize win to release another critically acclaimed album, 'Freedom Of Speech,' with \u2013 according to Scottish magazine The Skinny \u2013 \"a verve and vigour that more than justify the early hype\". The \"refreshingly outspoken\" album went on to \"trounce all expectations\" and was awarded CD of the week by Evening Standard.\nIn 2009, Ninja's longest-serving artist, DJ Food a.k.a. Strictly Kev, released the 2009 EP 'One Man's Weird Is Another Man's World,' and its 2010 follow up 'The Shape Of Things That Hum' made up two-thirds of a forthcoming album. In January 2012, 'The Search Engine' was released as the first DJ Food album in 11 years. As an album release event, DJ Food created his most ambitious live gig to date: a bespoke AV live show for London's only public planetarium, in conjunction with astronomers from The Royal Observatory Greenwich, using art from The Search Engine, images from Kev's own visual archive, plus a wealth of material provided by the astronomers themselves. Kev adapted his content to fit Montreal's Satosphere in July.\nIn mid 2012, The Bug announced that after \"London Zoo,\" he set out a new genre and sub-label with Ninja Tune: Acid Ragga. Releasing a set of 7\"'s, in June the first Bug track \u2013 \"Can't Take This No More\" \u2013 unleashed featuring the legendary Daddy Freddy, while on the flip \"Rise Up\" featured Inga Copeland of Hype Williams. The \"Ganja Baby\" 7-inch released shortly afterwards, featuring Daddy Freddy, followed by the 2 x 10\" Filthy EP featuring rapper Danny Brown and long time collaborator Flowdan.\nIn August 2012, London-based band The Invisible dropped their second album, the \"cerebral yet instantly accessible\" 'Rispah,' on Ninja Tune, having been recorded in Brighton \u2013 with producer Richard File. The trio's self-titled debut album (produced by Matthew Herbert) in 2009 was nominated for the Mercury Prize and selected as critics choice for iTunes album of the year. The band's tongue-in-cheek definition of their style of music is 'Experimental Genre-Spanning Spacepop'.\nIn 2012, Ninja Tune also struck a deal with game developer United Front Games and their publisher Square Enix for their game \"Sleeping Dogs\". Ninja Tune was featured as a in-game radio channel available to the player during gameplay, one of the ten total. The station featured a select group of works by the real life Ninja Tune record and their then artist lineup, including works by Bonobo, Lorn, Emika, Stateless, Two Fingers, and Cinematic Orchestra among others, for a total of 18 tracks.\nNinja Tune scored well at Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Awards 2013, with Brainfeeder winning \"Label of the Year\" \u2013 and Ninja Tune scoring 2nd \u2013 with the public vote. Invisible's \"Rispah\" also won album of the year.\nIn typical pioneering fashion, in February 2013, Ninja Tune spearheaded the launch of Beat Delete \u2013 a new service for out of press vinyl. The demise of Sony DADC warehouse in Edmonton (destroyed during the London riots in the summer of 2011), left many independent labels ravaged. Ninja Tune launched a website Beat Delete as a pledge scheme enabling fans to partially fund the release of rare collectibles.\nIn April 2013, Coldcut released Ninja Jamm, an iOS music remix app, in collaboration with London-based arts and technology firm Seeper. Geared toward both casual listeners and more experienced DJs and music producers, the freemium app allows users to download and remix \"Tunepacks\" that feature original tracks and mixes by Coldcut, as well as other Ninja artists, creating something new altogether. With the \"intuitive yet deep\" app, users can turn instruments on and off, swap between clips, add glitches and effects, trigger and pitch-bend stabs and one-off samples, and change the tempo of the track instantly.

Tunepack releases for Ninja Jamm are increasingly synchronised with Ninja Tune releases on conventional formats. To date over 20 tunepacks have been released, including Amon Tobin, Bonobo, Coldcut, DJ Food, Martyn, Emika, Machinedrum, Raffertie, Irresistible Force, Falty DL.\nIn March 2013, Bonobo unleashed his highly anticipated follow-up to \"Black Sands\", the triumphant and revelatory \"The North Borders\". Hailed as being sumptuous and accomplished, the album featured Erykah Badu, Motion Audio artist Grey Reverend, British singer Szjerdene and Swedish singer-songwriter Cornelia. Visual artist Cyriak's video for Bonobo's \"Cirrus\" was a cascading visual mantra that hit over 1 million views. The album charted at number 29 on the UK Album Charts. The following November, Bonobo released his contribution to the \"\" series with a 21-track selection, which Bonobo described as ranging \"from neo-classical to more abstract electronic pieces to spiritual jazz.\" Bonobo's popularity in the live spectrum continues to grow, having sold out a Roundhouse Ninja Tune festival in 2013 and Sydney Opera House. He has a live performance scheduled at Alexandra Palace in November 2014.\nAnother popular Ninja Tune artist, Travis Stewart, a.k.a. NYC/Berlin artist Machinedrum signed up with the label in 2013, first releasing \"Eyesdontlie\" that July, a single which XLR8R donned \"quite possibly deeper and more ambitious than anything we've heard from Stewart to date\". After releasing a second 12\" (\"Gunshotta Ave\") the following month, Machinedrum released his full LP \"Vapor City\" at the end of September 2013. A visceral album about an imaginary metropolis, \"Vapor City\" received much acclaim from critics and DJs alike, even landing three live performances on the Boiler Room (New York, Berlin and London). Machinedrum claimed it was his biggest and boldest project to date.\nIn January 2014, Big Dada released a deluxe European edition of Killer Mike and El-P's Run the Jewels album, featuring new artwork, a new colour vinyl LP + 12\" release plus deluxe CD and download editions.\nNinja Tune also released Actress' fourth album, \"Ghettoville\" in January 2014.

It was announced on 3 November 2016 with the release of the single \"Kerala\" and an official video. \nThe official video for the single is directed by Bison (Jon Hopkins/London Grammar/Rosie Lowe), featuring lead Gemma Arterton (\"Quantum of Solace\"/\"Inside No. 9\"). The album artwork was designed by Neil Krug (Boards of Canada/Lana Del Rey). The album features Nick Murphy, Rhye, Innov Gnawa and Hundred Waters. The album and the track \"Bambro Koyo Ganda\" were nominated for the 60th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Dance/Electronic Album. The album peaked higher in the UK chart (number 5) and in the US (number 59). In 2018, Bonobo's \"Migration\" album also won Album of the Year at the 2017 Electronic Music Awards and Bonobo was also nominated for Live Act of the Year. Around the release of the album, Bonobo performed sold-out shows at venues such as Brixton Academy and Alexandra Palace.\nOn 19 May 2017, Ninja Tune Founders Coldcut and Adrian Sherwood released their collaborative debut album \"Outside The Echo Chamber\" via Ninja imprint Ahead of our Time. Collaborators that featured on the album included Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Roots Manuva, Junior Reid, Ce\u2019Cile, Sugar Hill Gang alumni Skip McDonald and Doug Wimbish on Guitar and Bass respectively and production from Toddla T.\nIn 2017 Ahead Of Our Time released the album \"Stories From Far Away On Piano\" by James Heather, and also released its follow up in 2022, the album \"Invisible Forces\".\nAfter signing to Ninja Tune in 2017, Belfast based duo Bicep released their long-awaited debut album \"Bicep\", which reached the Top 20 of the UK Album Charts and received positive reviews on its release, with support from publications such as Pitchfork, The Guardian, Resident Advisor and a cover feature on Mixmag. They went on to play a sold-out show at London's Roundhouse.\n\"A Moment Apart\", Odesza's third studio album was released on 8 September 2017 on Ninja Tune imprint Counter Records.

The duo were also nominated for Producer of the Year at the 2017 Electronic Music Awards.\nYoung Fathers' third studio album, \"Cocoa Sugar,\" was announced with the single \"In My View\" on 17 January 2018. The album was released to critical acclaim on 9 March 2018. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 28, making it the band's highest-charting album. Due to their support of Palestinians through the BDS movement, the band was dropped from the 2018 Ruhrtriennale line-up.\nBerlin based South Korean Dj and Producer Peggy Gou released her EP \"Once\" in March 2018, with lead single \"It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)\", on which she sings in Korean, receiving widespread radio play on stations like BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music and more. This earned Peggy a place on publication Dazed's top 100 artists of the year.\nFollowing the release of the 'Audio Track 5' EP and live performances at the Strelka Institute (Moscow), Barbican Centre and the Tate Modern, electronic producer and musician Darren Cunningham AKA Actress and the London Contemporary Orchestra released a full album of their collaboration on 25 May 2018 entitled 'LAGEOS'. Originally performed at the Barbican in February 2016, the project was curated by Boiler Room and London Contemporary Orchestra with support from Arts Council England and Ninja Tune.\nIn December 2017, Ninja artist Helena Hauff became the first ever female DJ to be named BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix of the year. She was also rated number 1 in Crack Magazine's \"50 Most Exciting DJs Right Now\" 2017. On 3 August 2018 the Hamburg-based Techno producer and DJ released her album \"Qualm\". The album currently holds an 82% rating on Metacritic indicating \"Universal acclaim\", with five star write ups in publications such as The Guardian.\nThe subsidiary label Technicolour released Yu Su's \"Watermelon Woman\" EP in 2019.\nDesign.\nAs the imprint grew, Ninja grew into an 'anti-corporate' brand, supporting the work of visual artists, filmmakers, and mavericks of all media, running its own club nights and helping disseminate the work of its artists across the globe. From its very beginnings, Ninja Tune sought a strong visual identity, thanks to Michael Bartalos (whose original logo was a monochrome woodcut of a hooded ninja brandishing his long sword) and Mark Porter, Matt Black's friend from Oxford, Ninja's first art director who defined the logo and overall aesthetic (in addition to creating Ninja's striking yellow and black in-house record bags), and subsequently became Art Director at The Guardian. It was the arrival of Kevin Foakes as in-house designer in 1994 that developed the logo to its current international recognition, and became largely responsible for some of the label's most iconic artwork. Working as Openmind, Foakes has designed many of Ninja's album sleeves, including memorable covers for Amon Tobin, Coldcut and Funki Porcini's 2002 album \"Fast Asleep\". He's also commissioned acclaimed outside talent for a number of key projects.\nFoakes' Ninja logo has found its way in diverse remix forms onto DJ bags (the \"Wax Sack\"), cigarette lighters, T-shirts, turntable slip-mats, iPod skins (bearing the slogan \"Remember vinyl?\"), sunglasses by Japanese company Less Than Human and the label's own brand of cigarette rolling papers (\"Ninja Skins\"). French urban vinyl specialists Rolito also marketed a Foakes-designed toy Ninja, who came armed with a 3\" CD of Ninja Tunes.\nEwan Robertson (a.k.a. Offshore) and Oscar Bauer, were integral co-designers for Ninja Tune or Big Dada, responsible for iconic covers such as the |Playtime Is Over]]\", the Roots Manuva slime-head for \"Slime &amp; Reason\" and Bonobo's \"Black Sands\" triptych.\nSome Ninja Tune artists, meanwhile, design their own sleeves, such as Mr Scruff, whose cartoon illustrations are emblazoned across much of his catalogue and merchandise. Another prodigious cartoonist who designs his own sleeves is Kid Koala, whose \"Nufonia Must Fall\" graphic novel was published in 2003 by ECW Press in association with Ninja Tune, and whose 2000 debut album, \"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\", and its 2003 follow-up \"Some of My Best Friends Are DJs\" came accompanied by Koala-illustrated comic books.\nOther unique promotional Ninja Tune items include Coldcut's Top Trump-inspired \"Control Cards\", Amon Tobin ear-plugs, Kid Koala-illustrated playing cards, Mr Scruff-designed jigsaw puzzles, Scruff-branded tins of tuna-in-brine (to promote his 2008 LP \"Ninja Tuna\", which was available pre-loaded on a tuna-shaped USB stick), The Heavy and TTC-branded condoms, and plastic travelcard wallets emblazoned with artwork from Big Dada's \"Well Deep\" compilation and Roots Manuva's \"Slime &amp; Reason\" album.\nAs part of Ninja Tune's 20th Anniversary in 2010, 3500 Ninja Tune XX box sets were released, all housed in limited edition hi-spec packaging designed and conceived by Ninja artwork legend Openmind. In May 2013, golden ticket holders for Bonobo's Camden Roundhouse gig in London were given a limited edition 12\" for Bonobo's \"Cirrus\", which came in gatefold plastic cover with \"zoetrope\" viewer stand and art print, with picture disc art by Cyriak. In January 2014, Werkdiscs boss Actress released a boxset for a collection of photos presented by Hard Format, which included \"Ghettoville\" as vinyl and CD, as well as\u2014for the first time on vinyl\u2014a 2 LP white vinyl edition of \"Hazyville\" and CD. The boxset also contained a 40-page artbook, all carefully encased in a black \"elephant-skinned\" outer box.\nBonobo has collaborated with art director Leif Podhajsky and photographer Pelle Cr\u00e9pin to create covers for some of his albums. The cover of his 2010 album \"Black Sands\" was designed by design studio Oscar &amp; Ewan and features an image taken by Cr\u00e9pin. The three cover photographs form a triptych around Derwentwater in the Lake District. They were taken at each point on the map with each view capturing the place of the next photograph and the last photograph capturing the place of the first. The abstract cover for Bonobo's 2013 follow-up album The North Borders was created by Leif Podhajsky using a polaroid image of a wave. Podhajsky also provides the artwork for Bonobo's Flashlight EP in 2014, its cover art is a gold lava effect forming the inside sleeve glimpsed through tiny holes in a dark grey die-cut cover for the vinyl product. Leif Podhajsky again collaborated with Ninja Tune on the artwork for Kelis' 2014 album \"Food\".\nFor the release of Bonobo's sixth album \"Migration\" in January 2017, the album artwork was designed by Neil Krug. The physical artwork included photography of the Mojave Desert, with Krug capturing footage using a drone. This drone footage would come to form the video for \"Break Apart feat. Rhye\". He drove to the desert in the middle of the night to photograph the area just before sunrise, avoiding the sun's intense heat. The shots were then superimposed with various effects such as flames. The LP was accompanied by a special edition booklet containing meditations on themes from the album, the deluxe version housed in a gold-embossed PVC sleeve.\nIn 2017, Belfast based duo Bicep released their debut album \"Bicep\", with artwork created by design team Royal Studio in partnership with AnaTypes Type, Xesta Studio and Lyft Studio. Photographs of textures were digitally transformed, modulated, colored, gridded and regridded over and over again in hundreds of different formations. These arrangements of textures in different colorways were then sent to Bicep, who would select their highlights from each.\nThe artwork for Young Fathers' 2018 album \"Cocoa Sugar\" was created by photographer Noni Julia &amp; creative director Tom Hingston.\nPartnerships.\nSolid Steel.\nPre-dating Ninja Tune is the radio show Solid Steel, which Coldcut set up in 1988 and joined at a later date by DJ Food and DK. What initially began as a radio show on then-pirate Kiss FM went on to become a weekly 2-hour mix show broadcast online and syndicated to numerous radio stations around the world, with highlights available as a podcast on iTunes. Solid Steel is also the name of a series of DJ mix CDs from the label and various club nights showcasing the talents of the Solid Steel DJ's and a number of Ninja Tune artists.\nThe show, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013, showcases a varied blend of left field tunes, the broadest beats and forward-thinking selections. Being a freestyle eclectic mix, the weekly two-hour show was described by The Quietus as being \"the past mashed with the present plus a dash of the future\".\nIn addition to Solid Steel, Ninja Tune has conducted regular podcast interviews with their roster under the name \"The Ninja Tune Podcast\".\nBig Dada.\nHip hop label Big Dada was set up by journalist and writer Will Ashon in 1997. Big Dada was created with a similarly open-minded remit to sister label Ninja Tune, traversing the boundaries between hip hop, grime and ragga. Born out of a frustration over acts going unappreciated elsewhere, Big Dada swiftly cemented itself as a force in its own right. The name came up in reference to Ashon's love of Kool Keith, who he'd described in print as the \"Mac Dada\", as a combination of mac daddy and Dadaism.\nBig Dada began releasing 12\"'s in the summer of 1997, the first couple of which were produced by Luke Vibert. The label's debut release, \"Misanthropic\", featured Alpha Prhyme, a.k.a. Juice Aleem, soon to become a member of crew New Flesh for Old, who would release their own \"Electronic Bombardment\" on Big Dada that September. Since then, Big Dada has become home of some of the most maverick, forward-thinking and innovative artists in hip hop and beyond, including essential British hip hop artist Roots Manuva (Mercury Prize nominee), Mercury Prize winner Speech Debelle, UK hip hop artist TY (whose 2003 \"Upwards\" album was also Mercury nominated). Roots Manuva's album releases have been integral to the label, including \"Brand New Second Hand\", \"Run Come Save Me\", \"Awfully Deep\", \"Slime &amp; Reason\" and \"4everevolution\". Other notable artists include Diplo, cLOUDDEAD, Juice Aleem, DELS, Young Fathers (Mercury Prize Winner 2014) and Spank Rock, with a roster that's as prolific as it is varied. In the words of The Guardian, \"heaven help the music hack who tries to pigeonhole Big Dada's output\".\nIn 2021 the label relaunched as \"a label run by Black, POC &amp; Minority Ethnic people for Black, POC &amp; Minority Ethnic artists.\"\nBrainfeeder.\nBrainfeeder is an independent record label based in Los Angeles, California, founded by Warp Records recording artist Flying Lotus in 2008, focusing on electronic music and instrumental hip hop amongst other styles of music.\nWerkdiscs.\nWerkdiscs (formerly spelt as Werk Discs) is a British independent record label based in London. Originally a club night started by Darren J. Cunningham a.k.a. Actress, Ben Casey and Gavin Weale in the early 2000s,[11] Werkdiscs released their first record in the summer of 2004.\nNtone.\nIn 1994, Ninja Tune's first sister imprint was Ntone, a label that initially specialised in avant-garde music and in more electronically inclined ambience. Artists on the roster included Animals on Wheels, Cabbageboy, Hexstatic and Neotropic. Ntone was, in the words of Peter Quicke, \"for ambient and techno and other stuff that didn't quite fit Ninja Tune, but which we really liked, and didn't want to restrict ourselves from releasing.\" A collision of spacey dub and chilled ambient house, the first release was \"AntiStatic\" (TONE 1) by Hex released in February 1994, and last one \"Sunflower Girl\" (NTONE 45) by Neotropic in 2001."}

{"id": "21734", "revid": "1130794093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21734", "title": "New International Version", "text": "The New International Version (NIV) is a modern translation of the Bible in contemporary English. Published by Biblica, the complete NIV was released in 1978 with major revisions in 1984 and 2011. The NIV relies on recently published critical editions of the original Hebrew and Greek texts.\nBiblica claims that \"the NIV delivers the very best combination of accuracy and readability.\" As of March 2013, over 450 million printed copies of the translation had been distributed. The NIV is the best-selling translation in the United States.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nIn 1955, businessman Howard Long was convinced of the need for a contemporary English translation of the Bible while sharing the gospel with a business associate. He was unhappy with the King James Version that he used to communicate the gospel and was frustrated with its archaic language. He thought, \u201cEverywhere I go, in Canada, the U.S., anywhere, there are people who would like to read their Bible to their children at night. And they don\u2019t have something the children can grasp.\u201d He shared the frustration with his pastor Reverend Peter DeJong. Inspired by the great need for bible in contemporary English, the two men petitioned their denomination, Christian Reformed Church (CRC). After initial rejection and deferral, the CRC endorsed a committee to investigate the issue in 1957.\nThe NIV began with the formation of a small committee to study the value of producing a translation in the common language of the American people and a project of the National Association of Evangelicals in 1957. In 1964, a joint committee of representatives from the Christian Reformed Church and National Association of Evangelicals issued invitations to a translation conference and that conference met in August 1965 at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois. Two key decisions were made, the first was that \u201ca contemporary English translation of the Bible should be undertaken as a collegiate endeavor of evangelical scholars.\u201d The second was that a \u201ccontinuing committee of fifteen\u201d should be established to move the work forward. The \u201ccommittee of fifteen\u201d was ultimately named the Committee on Bible Translation (CBT) while the \u201cContemporary English Translation\u201d became the NIV. \nIn 1967, the New York Bible Society (now called Biblica) took responsibility for the project and hired a team of 15 scholars from various Evangelical Christian denominations and from various countries. The initial \"Committee on Bible Translation\" consisted of Leslie Carlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris, Earl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer, Charles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen W. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the full Bible in 1978. A UK version was also released, to accommodate differences between American English and British English. \nThe NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984.\nInclusive language editions.\nIn 1995 a new version of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, with the full Bible following in 1996 as the \"New International Version Inclusive Language Edition\", but was not published in the U.S. because of opposition from conservative evangelical groups there to gender-neutral language. A further edition with minor edits was published in 1999.\nA revised English edition titled \"Today's New International Version\" (TNIV), again using gender-neutral language, was released as a New Testament in March 2002, the complete Bible being published in February 2005.\n2011 update.\nIn 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released, with both the 1984 version and the TNIV being discontinued.\nThe update modified and dropped some of the gender-neutral language compared to TNIV. This includes going back to using \"mankind\" and \"man\" rather than \"human beings\" and \"people\", along with other changes. Keith Danby\u2014president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the TNIV\u2014said they had failed to convince people revisions were needed and underestimated readers' loyalty to the 1984 edition.\nDerivative versions.\nPlain English version (NIrV).\nAn 'easy-reader' version, \"New International Reader's Version\" (NIrV), was published in 1996; it was written at a third grade reading level.\nSpanish version (NVI).\nIn 1979, the decision was made to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish with the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versi\u00f3n Internacional (often abbreviated NVI), though at this point this version was based only on the former English translation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990, the committee on Bible translation headed by Drs. Ren\u00e9 Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a translation of both testaments from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish, bypassing English altogether and producing a complete Spanish NVI Bible in 1999.\nPortuguese version (NVI).\nIn 2001, the Nova Vers\u00e3o Internacional in Portuguese was published.\nTextual basis.\nThe manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and for the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New Testament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies and of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the translation.\nTranslation methodology.\nThe core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern English language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten years and involved a team of over 100 scholars from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The range of those participating included many different denominations such as Anglicans, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and Presbyterian.\nThe NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-thought or literal and phrase-by-phrase translations.\nRecent archaeological and linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have traditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional translations were generally retained.\nReception.\nAccording to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International Version has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible in CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide.\nThere are numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and background information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among these are the \"NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible\", \"Concordia Study Bible\", the Zondervan published \"NIV Study Bible\", the Wesleyan revision, \"Reflecting God Study Bible\", as well as the \"Life Application Study Bible\".\nIn 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured what Paul the Apostle was saying, making sure that Paul's words conformed to Protestant and Evangelical tradition. He claims, \"if a church only, or mainly, relies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was talking about,\" especially in Galatians and Romans. In support of this claim, Wright mentions specifically several verses of Romans 3, which he suggests do not convey how \"righteousness\" refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or reflect his own thinking about the \"pistis Christou\" debate. All editions of the NIV have given \"God's Faithfulness\" as the heading for Romans 3:1\u20138. Wright's specific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to the 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers \"the faithfulness of Jesus Christ\" as an alternative translation to \"faith in Jesus Christ\" in Romans 3:22.\nMark Given, a professor of religious studies at Missouri State University, criticized the NIV for \"several inaccurate and misleading translations\" as many sentences and clauses are paraphrased, rather than translated from Hebrew and Greek.\nMichael Marlowe, a scholar in biblical languages, criticized as \"indefensible\" the footnote provided in the NIV for , which replaced multiple instances of \"head covering\" with \"long hair\" in order to \"harmonize this passage with modern habits of dress\". Church historian David Bercot, whose focus is early Christianity, likewise deemed the footnote a \"fanciful interpretation\" that \"is in no way an alternate translation of the Greek text.\"\nOthers have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19 a translation such as the New Revised Standard Version uses \"formed\" in a plain past tense: \"So out of the ground the LORD God every animal\". Some have questioned the NIV's choice of pluperfect: \"Now the LORD God out of the ground all the wild animals\" to try to make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John Sailhamer states \"Not only is such a translation[...] hardly possible[...] but it misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were created in response to God's declaration that it was not good that the man should be alone.\"\nBiblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984 edition for the addition of \"just\" into Jeremiah 7:22 so the verse becomes \"For when I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not \"just\" give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" Metzger also criticized the addition of \"your\" into Matthew 13:32, so it becomes \"Though it [the mustard seed] is the smallest of all \"your\" seeds.\" The usage of \"your\" was removed in the 2011 revision.\n2011 revision.\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update, calling it \"a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through rigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy, and a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible appealing to the Christian reader.\" The Southern Baptist Convention rejected the 2011 update because of gender-neutral language, although it had dropped some gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision. Southern Baptist publisher LifeWay declined the SBC's censor request to remove the NIV from their stores. While the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations changes are right and defensible.\nProfessor of New Testament Studies Rodney J. Decker wrote in the \"Themelios Journal\" review of the NIV 2011:\nBy taking a mediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending, I think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to produce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those weighted more heavily with formal equivalence... If we are serious about making the word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then we must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the average English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only communicates the meaning of God's revelation accurately, but does so in English that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers. It is as well-suited for expository preaching as it is for public reading and use in Bible classes and children's ministries."}

Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. The Nazi Party emerged from the extremist German nationalist, racist and populist paramilitary culture, which fought against the communist uprisings in post\u2013World War\u00a0I Germany. The party was created to draw workers away from communism and into nationalism. Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti\u2013big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric. This was later downplayed to gain the support of business leaders, and in the 1930s, the party's main focus shifted to antisemitic and anti-Marxist themes. The party had little popular support until the Great Depression.\nPseudoscientific racist theories were central to Nazism, expressed in the idea of a \"people's community\" (). The party aimed to unite \"racially desirable\" Germans as national comrades, while excluding those deemed to be either political dissidents, physically or intellectually inferior, or of a foreign race (). The Nazis sought to strengthen the Germanic people, the \"Aryan master race\", through racial purity and eugenics, broad social welfare programs, and a collective subordination of individual rights, which could be sacrificed for the good of the state on behalf of the people. To protect the supposed purity and strength of the Aryan race, the Nazis sought to exterminate Jews, Romani, Poles and most other Slavs, along with the physically and mentally disabled. They disenfranchised and segregated homosexuals, black people, Jehovah's Witnesses, and political opponents. The persecution reached its climax when the party-controlled German state set in motion the Final Solution\u2014an industrial system of genocide which achieved the murder of around 6\u00a0million Jews and millions of other targeted victims, in what has become known as the Holocaust.\nAdolf Hitler, the party's leader since 1921, was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg on 30\u00a0January 1933. Hitler rapidly established a totalitarian regime known as the Third Reich. Following the defeat of the Third Reich at the end of World War\u00a0II in Europe, the party was declared to be illegal by the Allied powers, who carried out denazification in the years after the war both in Germany and in territories occupied by Nazi forces. The use of any symbols associated with the party is now outlawed in many European countries, including Germany and Austria.\nName.\n, the informal and originally derogatory term for a party member, abbreviates the party's name ( ), and was coined in analogy with (pronounced ), an abbreviation of (member of the rival Social Democratic Party of Germany). Members of the party referred to themselves as (National Socialists), but some did occasionally embrace the colloquial (so Leopold von Mildenstein in his article series published in in 1934). The term (party member) was commonly used among Nazis, with its corresponding feminine form .\nThe term was in use before the rise of the party as a colloquial and derogatory word for a backward peasant, an awkward and clumsy person. It derived from Ignaz, a shortened version of Ignatius, which was a common name in the Nazis' home region of Bavaria. Opponents seized on this, and the long-existing , to attach a dismissive nickname to the National Socialists.\nIn 1933, when Adolf Hitler assumed power in the German government, the usage of \"Nazi\" diminished in Germany, although Austrian anti-Nazis continued to use the term, and the use of \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Nazi regime\" was popularised by anti-Nazis and German exiles abroad. Thereafter, the term spread into other languages and eventually was brought back to Germany after World War II. In English, the term is not considered slang and has such derivatives as Nazism and denazification.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early years: 1918\u20131923.\nThe party grew out of smaller political groups with a nationalist orientation that formed in the last years of World War\u00a0I. In 1918, a league called the (Free Workers' Committee for a good Peace) was created in Bremen, Germany. On 7 March 1918, Anton Drexler, an avid German nationalist, formed a branch of this league in Munich. Drexler was a local locksmith who had been a member of the militarist Fatherland Party during World War I and was bitterly opposed to the armistice of November 1918 and the revolutionary upheavals that followed. Drexler followed the views of militant nationalists of the day, such as opposing the Treaty of Versailles, having antisemitic, anti-monarchist and anti-Marxist views, as well as believing in the superiority of Germans whom they claimed to be part of the Aryan \"master race\" (). However, he also accused international capitalism of being a Jewish-dominated movement and denounced capitalists for war profiteering in World War I. Drexler saw the political violence and instability in Germany as the result of the Weimar Republic being out-of-touch with the masses, especially the lower classes. Drexler emphasised the need for a synthesis of nationalism with a form of economic socialism, in order to create a popular nationalist-oriented workers' movement that could challenge the rise of Communism and internationalist politics. These were all well-known themes popular with various Weimar paramilitary groups such as the .\nDrexler's movement received attention and support from some influential figures. Supporter Dietrich Eckart, a well-to-do journalist, brought military figure Felix Graf von Bothmer, a prominent supporter of the concept of \"national socialism\", to address the movement. Later in 1918, Karl Harrer (a journalist and member of the Thule Society) convinced Drexler and several others to form the (Political Workers' Circle). The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and racism directed against Jewish people. In December 1918, Drexler decided that a new political party should be formed, based on the political principles that he endorsed, by combining his branch of the Workers' Committee for a good Peace with the Political Workers' Circle.\nOn 5 January 1919, Drexler created a new political party and proposed it should be named the \"German Socialist Workers' Party\", but Harrer objected to the term \"socialist\"; so the term was removed and the party was named the German Workers' Party (, DAP). To ease concerns among potential middle-class supporters, Drexler made clear that unlike Marxists the party supported the middle-class and that its socialist policy was meant to give social welfare to German citizens deemed part of the Aryan race. They became one of many \"v\u00f6lkisch\" movements that existed in Germany. Like other groups, the DAP advocated the belief that through profit-sharing instead of socialisation Germany should become a unified \"people's community\" () rather than a society divided along class and party lines. This ideology was explicitly antisemitic. As early as 1920, the party was raising money by selling a tobacco called .\nFrom the outset, the DAP was opposed to non-nationalist political movements, especially on the left, including the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Members of the DAP saw themselves as fighting against \"Bolshevism\" and anyone considered a part of or aiding so-called \"international Jewry\". The DAP was also deeply opposed to the Treaty of Versailles. The DAP did not attempt to make itself public and meetings were kept in relative secrecy, with public speakers discussing what they thought of Germany's present state of affairs, or writing to like-minded societies in Northern Germany.\nThe DAP was a comparatively small group with fewer than 60 members. Nevertheless, it attracted the attention of the German authorities, who were suspicious of any organisation that appeared to have subversive tendencies. In July 1919, while stationed in Munich, army Adolf Hitler was appointed a (intelligence agent) of an (reconnaissance unit) of the (army) by Captain Mayr, the head of the \"Education and Propaganda Department\" (Dept Ib/P) in Bavaria. Hitler was assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the DAP. While attending a party meeting on 12 September 1919 at Munich's Sterneckerbr\u00e4u, Hitler became involved in a heated argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Gottfried Feder's arguments against capitalism; Baumann proposed that Bavaria should break away from Prussia and found a new South German nation with Austria. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, Hitler made an impression on the other party members with his oratorical skills; according to Hitler, the \"professor\" left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat. Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party). Among the party's earlier members were Ernst R\u00f6hm of the Army's District Command VII; Dietrich Eckart, who has been called the spiritual father of National Socialism; then-University of Munich student Rudolf Hess; soldier Hans Frank; and Alfred Rosenberg, often credited as the philosopher of the movement. All were later prominent in the Nazi regime.\nHitler later claimed to be the seventh party member (he was in fact the seventh executive member of the party's central committee and he would later wear the Golden Party Badge number one). Anton Drexler drafted a letter to Hitler in 1940\u2014which was never sent\u2014that contradicts Hitler's later claim:\nHitler's first DAP speech was held in the Hofbr\u00e4ukeller on 16 October 1919. He was the second speaker of the evening, and spoke to 111 people. Hitler later declared that this was when he realised he could really \"make a good speech\". At first, Hitler spoke only to relatively small groups, but his considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920. Hitler began to make the party more public, and organised its biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people on 24 February 1920 in the . Such was the significance of this particular move in publicity that Karl Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement. It was in this speech that Hitler enunciated the twenty-five points of the German Workers' Party manifesto that had been drawn up by Drexler, Feder and himself. Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem with a clear foreign policy (abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles, a Greater Germany, Eastern expansion and exclusion of Jews from citizenship) and among his specific points were: confiscation of war profits, abolition of unearned incomes, the State to share profits of land and land for national needs to be taken away without compensation. In general, the manifesto was antisemitic, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, anti-Marxist and anti-liberal. To increase its appeal to larger segments of the population, on the same day as Hitler's speech on 24 February 1920, the DAP changed its name to the (\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\", or Nazi Party). The word \"Socialist\" was added by the party's executive committee (at the suggestion of Rudolf Jung), over Hitler's initial objections, in order to help appeal to left-wing workers.\nIn 1920, the Nazi Party officially announced that only persons of \"pure Aryan descent []\" could become party members and if the person had a spouse, the spouse also had to be a \"racially pure\" Aryan. Party members could not be related either directly or indirectly to a so-called \"non-Aryan\". Even before it had become legally forbidden by the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, the Nazis banned sexual relations and marriages between party members and Jews. Party members found guilty of (\"racial defilement\") were persecuted heavily. Some members were even sentenced to death.\nHitler quickly became the party's most active orator, appearing in public as a speaker 31 times within the first year after his self-discovery. Crowds began to flock to hear his speeches. Hitler always spoke about the same subjects: the Treaty of Versailles and the Jewish question. This deliberate technique and effective publicising of the party contributed significantly to his early success, about which a contemporary poster wrote: \"Since Herr Hitler is a brilliant speaker, we can hold out the prospect of an extremely exciting evening\". Over the following months, the party continued to attract new members, while remaining too small to have any real significance in German politics. By the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000, many of whom Hitler and R\u00f6hm had brought into the party personally, or for whom Hitler's oratory had been their reason for joining.\nHitler's talent as an orator and his ability to draw new members, combined with his characteristic ruthlessness, soon made him the dominant figure. However, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin in June 1921, a mutiny broke out within the party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Upon returning to Munich on 11 July, Hitler angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that his resignation would mean the end of the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP, as his opponents had Hermann Esser expelled from the party and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser to thunderous applause.\nHis strategy proved successful; at a special party congress on 29 July 1921, he replaced Drexler as party chairman by a vote of 533to1. The committee was dissolved, and Hitler was granted nearly absolute powers as the party's sole leader. He would hold the post for the remainder of his life. Hitler soon acquired the title (\"leader\") and after a series of sharp internal conflicts it was accepted that the party would be governed by the (\"leader principle\"). Under this principle, the party was a highly centralised entity that functioned strictly from the top down, with Hitler at the apex as the party's absolute leader. Hitler saw the party as a revolutionary organisation, whose aim was the overthrow of the Weimar Republic, which he saw as controlled by the socialists, Jews and the \"November criminals\" who had betrayed the German soldiers in 1918. The SA (\"storm troopers\", also known as \"Brownshirts\") were founded as a party militia in 1921 and began violent attacks on other parties.\nFor Hitler, the twin goals of the party were always German nationalist expansionism and antisemitism. These two goals were fused in his mind by his belief that Germany's external enemies\u2014Britain, France and the Soviet Union\u2014were controlled by the Jews and that Germany's future wars of national expansion would necessarily entail a war of annihilation against them. For Hitler and his principal lieutenants, national and racial issues were always dominant. This was symbolised by the adoption as the party emblem of the swastika. In German nationalist circles, the swastika was considered a symbol of an \"Aryan race\" and it symbolised the replacement of the Christian Cross with allegiance to a National Socialist State.\nThe Nazi Party grew significantly during 1921 and 1922, partly through Hitler's oratorical skills, partly through the SA's appeal to unemployed young men, and partly because there was a backlash against socialist and liberal politics in Bavaria as Germany's economic problems deepened and the weakness of the Weimar regime became apparent. The party recruited former World War\u00a0I soldiers, to whom Hitler as a decorated frontline veteran could particularly appeal, as well as small businessmen and disaffected former members of rival parties. Nazi rallies were often held in beer halls, where downtrodden men could get free beer. The Hitler Youth was formed for the children of party members. The party also formed groups in other parts of Germany. Julius Streicher in Nuremberg was an early recruit and became editor of the racist magazine . In December 1920, the Nazi Party had acquired a newspaper, the , of which its leading ideologist Alfred Rosenberg became editor. Others to join the party around this time were Heinrich Himmler and World War I flying ace Hermann G\u00f6ring.\nAdoption of Italian fascism: The Beer Hall Putsch.\nOn 31 October 1922, a fascist party with similar policies and objectives came into power in Italy, the National Fascist Party, under the leadership of the charismatic Benito Mussolini. The Fascists, like the Nazis, promoted a national rebirth of their country, as they opposed communism and liberalism; appealed to the working-class; opposed the Treaty of Versailles; and advocated the territorial expansion of their country. Hitler was inspired by Mussolini and the Fascists, beginning to adopt elements of the Fascist's and Mussolini for the Nazi Party and himself. The Italian Fascists also used a straight-armed Roman salute and wore black-shirted uniforms; Hitler would later borrow their use of the straight-armed salute as a Nazi salute.\nWhen the Fascists took control of Italy through their coup d'\u00e9tat called the \"March on Rome\", Hitler began planning his own coup less than a month later. In January 1923, France occupied the Ruhr industrial region as a result of Germany's failure to meet its reparations payments. This led to economic chaos, the resignation of Wilhelm Cuno's government and an attempt by the German Communist Party (KPD) to stage a revolution. The reaction to these events was an upsurge of nationalist sentiment. Nazi Party membership grew sharply to about 20,000. By November 1923, Hitler had decided that the time was right for an attempt to seize power in Munich, in the hope that the (the post-war German military) would mutiny against the Berlin government and join his revolt. In this, he was influenced by former General Erich Ludendorff, who had become a supporter\u2014though not a member\u2014of the Nazis.\nOn the night of 8 November, the Nazis used a patriotic rally in a Munich beer hall to launch an attempted (\"coup d'\u00e9tat\"). This so-called Beer Hall Putsch attempt failed almost at once when the local commanders refused to support it. On the morning of 9 November, the Nazis staged a march of about 2,000 supporters through Munich in an attempt to rally support. Troops opened fire and 16 Nazis were killed. Hitler, Ludendorff and a number of others were arrested and were tried for treason in March 1924. Hitler and his associates were given very lenient prison sentences. While Hitler was in prison, he wrote his semi-autobiographical political manifesto (\"My Struggle\").\nThe Nazi Party was banned on 9 November 1923; however, with the support of the nationalist V\u00f6lkisch-Social Bloc (), it continued to operate under the name \"German Party\" ( or DP) from 1924 to 1925. The Nazis failed to remain unified in the DP, as in the north, the right-wing Volkish nationalist supporters of the Nazis moved to the new German V\u00f6lkisch Freedom Party, leaving the north's left-wing Nazi members, such as Joseph Goebbels retaining support for the party.\nRise to power: 1925\u20131933.\nAdolf Hitler was released from prison on 20 December 1924. On 16 February 1925, Hitler convinced the Bavarian authorities to lift the ban on the NSDAP and the party was formally refounded on 26 February 1925, with Hitler as its undisputed leader. The new Nazi Party was no longer a paramilitary organisation and disavowed any intention of taking power by force. In any case, the economic and political situation had stabilised and the extremist upsurge of 1923 had faded, so there was no prospect of further revolutionary adventures. The Nazi Party of 1925 was divided into the \"Leadership Corps\" () appointed by Hitler and the general membership (). The party and the SA were kept separate and the legal aspect of the party's work was emphasised. In a sign of this, the party began to admit women. The SA and the SS members (the latter founded in 1925 as Hitler's bodyguard, and known originally as the ) had to all be regular party members.\nIn the 1920s, the Nazi Party expanded beyond its Bavarian base. Catholic Bavaria maintained its right-wing nostalgia for a Catholic monarch; and Westphalia, along with working-class \"Red Berlin\", were always the Nazis' weakest areas electorally, even during the Third Reich itself. The areas of strongest Nazi support were in rural Protestant areas such as Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg, Pomerania and East Prussia. Depressed working-class areas such as Thuringia also produced a strong Nazi vote, while the workers of the Ruhr and Hamburg largely remained loyal to the Social Democrats, the Communist Party of Germany or the Catholic Centre Party. Nuremberg remained a Nazi Party stronghold, and the first Nuremberg Rally was held there in 1927. These rallies soon became massive displays of Nazi paramilitary power and attracted many recruits. The Nazis' strongest appeal was to the lower middle-classes\u2014farmers, public servants, teachers and small businessmen\u2014who had suffered most from the inflation of the 1920s, so who feared Bolshevism more than anything else. The small business class was receptive to Hitler's antisemitism, since it blamed Jewish big business for its economic problems. University students, disappointed at being too young to have served in the War of 1914\u20131918 and attracted by the Nazis' radical rhetoric, also became a strong Nazi constituency. By 1929, the party had 130,000 members.\nThe party's nominal Deputy Leader was Rudolf Hess, but he had no real power in the party. By the early 1930s, the senior leaders of the party after Hitler were Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels and Hermann G\u00f6ring. Beneath the Leadership Corps were the party's regional leaders, the , each of whom commanded the party in his (\"region\"). Goebbels began his ascent through the party hierarchy as of Berlin-Brandenburg in 1926. Streicher was of Franconia, where he published his antisemitic newspaper . Beneath the were lower-level officials, the (\"county leaders\"), (\"cell leaders\") and (\"block leaders\"). This was a strictly hierarchical structure in which orders flowed from the top and unquestioning loyalty was given to superiors. Only the SA retained some autonomy. Being composed largely of unemployed workers, many SA men took the Nazis' socialist rhetoric seriously. At this time, the Hitler salute (borrowed from the Italian fascists) and the greeting \"Heil Hitler!\" were adopted throughout the party.\nThe Nazis contested elections to the national parliament (the ) and to the state legislature (the ) from 1924, although at first with little success. The \"National Socialist Freedom Movement\" polled 3% of the vote in the December 1924 \"Reichstag\" elections and this fell to 2.6% in 1928. State elections produced similar results. Despite these poor results and despite Germany's relative political stability and prosperity during the later 1920s, the Nazi Party continued to grow. This was partly because Hitler, who had no administrative ability, left the party organisation to the head of the secretariat, Philipp Bouhler, the party treasurer Franz Xaver Schwarz and business manager Max Amann. The party had a capable propaganda head in Gregor Strasser, who was promoted to national organizational leader in January 1928. These men gave the party efficient recruitment and organizational structures. The party also owed its growth to the gradual fading away of competitor nationalist groups, such as the German National People's Party (DNVP). As Hitler became the recognised head of the German nationalists, other groups declined or were absorbed.\nDespite these strengths, the Nazi Party might never have come to power had it not been for the Great Depression and its effects on Germany. By 1930, the German economy was beset with mass unemployment and widespread business failures. The Social Democrats and Communists were bitterly divided and unable to formulate an effective solution: this gave the Nazis their opportunity and Hitler's message, blaming the crisis on the Jewish financiers and the Bolsheviks, resonated with wide sections of the electorate. At the September 1930 \"Reichstag\" elections, the Nazis won 18% of the votes and became the second-largest party in the after the Social Democrats. Hitler proved to be a highly effective campaigner, pioneering the use of radio and aircraft for this purpose. His dismissal of Strasser and his appointment of Goebbels as the party's propaganda chief were major factors. While Strasser had used his position to promote his own leftish version of national socialism, Goebbels was completely loyal to Hitler, and worked only to improve Hitler's image.\nThe 1930 elections changed the German political landscape by weakening the traditional nationalist parties, the DNVP and the DVP, leaving the Nazis as the chief alternative to the discredited Social Democrats and the Zentrum, whose leader, Heinrich Br\u00fcning, headed a weak minority government. The inability of the democratic parties to form a united front, the self-imposed isolation of the Communists and the continued decline of the economy, all played into Hitler's hands. He now came to be seen as \"de facto\" leader of the opposition and donations poured into the Nazi Party's coffers. Some major business figures, such as Fritz Thyssen, were Nazi supporters and gave generously and some Wall Street figures were allegedly involved, but many other businessmen were suspicious of the extreme nationalist tendencies of the Nazis and preferred to support the traditional conservative parties instead.\nDuring 1931 and into 1932, Germany's political crisis deepened. Hitler ran for president against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg in March 1932, polling 30% in the first round and 37% in the second against Hindenburg's 49% and 53%. By now the SA had 400,000 members and its running street battles with the SPD and Communist paramilitaries (who also fought each other) reduced some German cities to combat zones. Paradoxically, although the Nazis were among the main instigators of this disorder, part of Hitler's appeal to a frightened and demoralised middle class was his promise to restore law and order. Overt antisemitism was played down in official Nazi rhetoric, but was never far from the surface. Germans voted for Hitler primarily because of his promises to revive the economy (by unspecified means), to restore German greatness and overturn the Treaty of Versailles and to save Germany from communism. On 24 April 1932, the Free State of Prussia elections to the Landtag resulted in 36% of the votes and 162 seats for the NSDAP.\nOn 20 July 1932, the Prussian government was ousted by a coup, the ; a few days later at the July 1932 \"Reichstag\" election the Nazis made another leap forward, polling 37% and becoming the largest party in parliament by a wide margin. Furthermore, the Nazis and the Communists between them won 52% of the vote and a majority of seats. Since both parties opposed the established political system and neither would join or support any ministry, this made the formation of a majority government impossible. The result was weak ministries governing by decree. Under Comintern directives, the Communists maintained their policy of treating the Social Democrats as the main enemy, calling them \"social fascists\", thereby splintering opposition to the Nazis. Later, both the Social Democrats and the Communists accused each other of having facilitated Hitler's rise to power by their unwillingness to compromise.\nChancellor Franz von Papen called another election in November, hoping to find a way out of this impasse. The electoral result was the same, with the Nazis and the Communists winning 50% of the vote between them and more than half the seats, rendering this no more workable than its predecessor. However, support for the Nazis had fallen to 33.1%, suggesting that the Nazi surge had passed its peak\u2014possibly because the worst of the Depression had passed, possibly because some middle-class voters had supported Hitler in July as a protest, but had now drawn back from the prospect of actually putting him into power. The Nazis interpreted the result as a warning that they must seize power before their moment passed. Had the other parties united, this could have been prevented, but their shortsightedness made a united front impossible. Papen, his successor Kurt von Schleicher and the nationalist press magnate Alfred Hugenberg spent December and January in political intrigues that eventually persuaded President Hindenburg that it was safe to appoint Hitler as Reich Chancellor, at the head of a cabinet including only a minority of Nazi ministers\u2014which he did on 30 January 1933.\nAscension and consolidation.\nIn \"Mein Kampf\", Hitler directly attacked both left-wing and right-wing politics in Germany. However, a majority of scholars identify Nazism in practice as being a far-right form of politics. When asked in an interview in 1934 whether the Nazis were \"bourgeois right-wing\" as alleged by their opponents, Hitler responded that Nazism was not exclusively for any class and indicated that it favoured neither the left nor the right, but preserved \"pure\" elements from both \"camps\" by stating: \"From the camp of bourgeois tradition, it takes national resolve, and from the materialism of the Marxist dogma, living, creative Socialism\".\nThe votes that the Nazis received in the 1932 elections established the Nazi Party as the largest parliamentary faction of the Weimar Republic government. Hitler was appointed as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.\nThe \"Reichstag\" fire on 27 February 1933 gave Hitler a pretext for suppressing his political opponents. The following day he persuaded the Reich's President Paul von Hindenburg to issue the \"Reichstag\" Fire Decree, which suspended most civil liberties. The NSDAP won the parliamentary election on 5 March 1933 with 44% of votes, but failed to win an absolute majority. After the election, hundreds of thousands of new members joined the party for opportunistic reasons, most of them civil servants and white-collar workers. They were nicknamed the \"casualties of March\" () or \"March violets\" (). To protect the party from too many non-ideological turncoats who were viewed by the so-called \"old fighters\" with some mistrust, the party issued a freeze on admissions that remained in force from May 1933 to 1937.\nOn 23 March, the parliament passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which gave the cabinet the right to enact laws without the consent of parliament. In effect, this gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Now possessing virtually absolute power, the Nazis established totalitarian control as they abolished labour unions and other political parties and imprisoned their political opponents, first at , improvised camps, then in concentration camps. Nazi Germany had been established, yet the remained impartial. Nazi power over Germany remained virtual, not absolute.\nAfter taking power: intertwining of party and state.\nDuring June and July 1933, all competing parties were either outlawed or dissolved themselves and subsequently the Law against the founding of new parties of 14 July 1933 legally established the Nazi Party's monopoly. On 1 December 1933, the Law to secure the unity of party and state entered into force, which was the base for a progressive intertwining of party structures and state apparatus. By this law, the SA\u2014actually a party division\u2014was given quasi-governmental authority and their leader was co-opted as an \"ex officio\" cabinet member. By virtue of a 30 January 1934 Law concerning the reorganisation of the , the (states) lost their statehood and were demoted to administrative divisions of the 's government . Effectively, they lost most of their power to the that were originally just regional divisions of the party, but took over most competencies of the state administration in their respective sectors.\nDuring the R\u00f6hm Purge of 30 June to 2 July 1934 (also known as the \"Night of the Long Knives\"), Hitler disempowered the SA's leadership\u2014most of whom belonged to the Strasserist (national revolutionary) faction within the NSDAP\u2014and ordered them killed. He accused them of having conspired to stage a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\", but it is believed that this was only a pretence to justify the suppression of any intraparty opposition. The purge was executed by the SS, assisted by the Gestapo and Reichswehr units. Aside from Strasserist Nazis, they also murdered anti-Nazi conservative figures like former chancellor von Schleicher. After this, the SA continued to exist but lost much of its importance, while the role of the SS grew significantly. Formerly only a sub-organisation of the SA, it was made into a separate organisation of the NSDAP in July 1934.\nAfter the death of President Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Hitler merged the offices of party leader, head of state and chief of government in one, taking the title of . The Chancellery of the F\u00fchrer, officially an organisation of the Nazi Party, took over the functions of the Office of the President (a government agency), blurring the distinction between structures of party and state even further. The SS increasingly exerted police functions, a development which was formally documented by the merger of the offices of and Chief of the German Police on 17 June 1936, as the position was held by Heinrich Himmler who derived his authority directly from Hitler. The (SD, formally the \"Security Service of the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\") that had been created in 1931 as an intraparty intelligence became the \"de facto\" intelligence agency of Nazi Germany. It was put under the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in 1939, which then coordinated SD, Gestapo and criminal police, therefore functioning as a hybrid organisation of state and party structures.\nDefeat and abolition.\nOfficially, the Third Reich lasted only 12 years. The Instrument of Surrender was signed by representatives of the German High Command at Berlin, on 8 May 1945, when the war ended in Europe. The defeat of Germany in World War II marked the end of the Nazi Germany era. The party was formally abolished on 10 October 1945 by the Allied Control Council and denazification began, along with trials of major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) in Nuremberg. Part of the Potsdam Agreement called for the destruction of the National Socialist Party alongside the requirement for the reconstruction of the German political life. In addition, the Control Council Law no. 2 Providing for the Termination and Liquidation of the Nazi Organization specified the abolition of 52 other Nazi affiliated and supervised organisations and prohibited their activities. The denazification was carried out in Germany and continued until the onset of the Cold War.\nBetween 1939 and 1945, the Nazi Party led regime, assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6\u00a0million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people. The estimated total number includes the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists, and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled.\nPolitical programme.\nThe National Socialist Programme was a formulation of the policies of the party. It contained 25 points and is therefore also known as the \"25-point plan\" or \"25-point programme\". It was the official party programme, with minor changes, from its proclamation as such by Hitler in 1920, when the party was still the German Workers' Party, until its dissolution.\nParty composition.\nCommand structure.\nTop leadership.\nAt the top of the Nazi Party was the party chairman (\"\"), who held absolute power and full command over the party. All other party offices were subordinate to his position and had to depend on his instructions. In 1934, Hitler founded a separate body for the chairman, Chancellery of the F\u00fchrer, with its own sub-units.\nBelow the F\u00fchrer's chancellery was first the \"Staff of the Deputy F\u00fchrer\", headed by Rudolf Hess from 21 April 1933 to 10 May 1941; and then the \"Party Chancellery\" (), headed by Martin Bormann.\n\"Reichsleiter\".\nDirectly subjected to the F\u00fchrer were the (\"Reich Leader(s)\"\u2014the singular and plural forms are identical in German), whose number was gradually increased to eighteen. They held power and influence comparable to the Reich Ministers' in Hitler's Cabinet. The eighteen formed the \"Reich Leadership of the Nazi Party\" (), which was established at the so-called Brown House in Munich. Unlike a , a did not have individual geographic areas under their command, but were responsible for specific spheres of interest.\nNazi Party offices.\nThe Nazi Party had a number of party offices dealing with various political and other matters. These included:\nParamilitary groups.\nIn addition to the Nazi Party proper, several paramilitary groups existed which \"supported\" Nazi aims. All members of these paramilitary organisations were required to become regular Nazi Party members first and could then enlist in the group of their choice. An exception was the Waffen-SS, considered the military arm of the SS and Nazi Party, which during the Second World War allowed members to enlist without joining the Nazi Party. Foreign volunteers of the Waffen-SS were also not required to be members of the Nazi Party, although many joined local nationalist groups from their own countries with the same aims. Police officers, including members of the Gestapo, frequently held SS rank for administrative reasons (known as \"rank parity\") and were likewise not required to be members of the Nazi Party.\nA vast system of Nazi Party paramilitary ranks developed for each of the various paramilitary groups. This was part of the process of with the paramilitary and auxiliary groups swallowing existing associations and federations after the Party was flooded by millions of membership applications.\nThe major Nazi Party paramilitary groups were as follows:\nThe Hitler Youth was a paramilitary group divided into an adult leadership corps and a general membership open to boys aged fourteen to eighteen. The League of German Girls was the equivalent group for girls.\nAffiliated organisations.\nCertain nominally independent organisations had their own legal representation and own property, but were supported by the Nazi Party. Many of these associated organisations were labour unions of various professions. Some were older organisations that were nazified according to the policy after the 1933 takeover.\nThe employees of large businesses with international operations such as Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank were mostly party members. All German businesses abroad were also required to have their own Nazi Party liaison men, which enabled the party leadership to obtain updated and excellent intelligence on the actions of the global corporate elites.\nRegional administration.\nFor the purpose of centralisation in the process a rigidly hierarchal structure was established in the Nazi Party, which it later carried through in the whole of Germany in order to consolidate total power under the person of Hitler (). It was regionally sub-divided into a number of (singular: ) headed by a , who received their orders directly from Hitler. The name (originally a term for sub-regions of the Holy Roman Empire headed by a ) for these new provincial structures was deliberately chosen because of its mediaeval connotations. The term is approximately equivalent to the English .\nWhile the Nazis maintained the nominal existence of state and regional governments in Germany itself, this policy was not extended to territories acquired after 1937. Even in German-speaking areas such as Austria, state and regional governments were formally disbanded as opposed to just being dis-empowered.\nAfter the a new type of administrative unit was introduced called a . In these territories the also held the position of (Reich Governor) thereby formally combining the spheres of both party and state offices. The establishment of this type of district was subsequently carried out for any further territorial annexations of Germany both before and during World War II. Even the former territories of Prussia were never formally re-integrated into what was then Germany's largest state after being re-taken in the 1939 Polish campaign.\nThe and (state or province) were further sub-divided into (counties) headed by a , which were in turn sub-divided into (cells) and (blocks), headed by a and respectively.\nA reorganisation of the \"Gaue\" was enacted on 1 October 1928. The given numbers were the official ordering numbers. The statistics are from 1941, for which the \"Gau\" organisation of that moment in time forms the basis. Their size and populations are not exact; for instance, according to the official party statistics the \"Gau\" Kurmark/Mark Brandenburg was the largest in the German Reich. By 1941, there were 42 territorial \"Gaue\" for Greater Germany. Of these, 10 were designated as Reichsgaue: 7 of them for Austria, one for the Sudetenland (annexed from Czechoslovakia) and two for the areas annexed from Poland and the Free City of Danzig after the joint invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939 at the onset of World War II. Getting the leadership of the individual \"Gaue\" to co-operate with one another proved difficult at times since there was constant administrative and financial jockeying for control going on between them.\nThe first table below describes the organizational structure for the \"Gaue\" that existed before their dissolution in 1945. Information on former \"Gaue\" (that were either renamed, or dissolved by being divided or merged with other \"Gaue\") is provided in the second table.\nNazi Party \"Gaue\".\nLater Gaue:\n\"Gaue\" dissolved before 1945.\nThe numbering is not based on any official former ranking, but merely listed alphabetically. that were simply renamed without territorial changes bear the designation RN in the column \"later became.\" that were divided into more than one bear the designation D in the column \"later became.\" that were merged with other (or occupied territory) bear the designation M in the column \"together with.\"\nAssociated organisations abroad.\n\"Gaue\" in Switzerland.\nThe irregular Swiss branch of the Nazi Party also established a number of Party in that country, most of them named after their regional capitals. These included , , , and . The (East Switzerland) combined the territories of three cantons: St. Gallen, Thurgau and Appenzell.\nMembership.\nGeneral membership.\nThe general membership of the Nazi Party mainly consisted of the urban and rural lower middle classes. 7% belonged to the upper class, another 7% were peasants, 35% were industrial workers and 51% were what can be described as middle class. In early 1933, just before Hitler's appointment to the chancellorship, the party showed an under-representation of \"workers\", who made up 30% of the membership but 46% of German society. Conversely, white-collar employees (19% of members and 12% of Germans), the self-employed (20% of members and 10% of Germans) and civil servants (15% of members and 5% of the German population) had joined in proportions greater than their share of the general population. These members were affiliated with local branches of the party, of which there were 1,378 throughout the country in 1928. In 1932, the number had risen to 11,845, reflecting the party's growth in this period.\nWhen it came to power in 1933, the Nazi Party had over members. In 1939, the membership total rose to 5.3 million with 81% being male and 19% being female. It continued to attract many more and by 1945 the party reached its peak of 8 million with 63% being male and 37% being female (about 10% of the German population of 80 million).\nMilitary membership.\nNazi members with military ambitions were encouraged to join the Waffen-SS, but a great number enlisted in the and even more were drafted for service after World War II began. Early regulations required that all members be non-political and any Nazi member joining in the 1930s was required to resign from the Nazi Party.\nHowever, this regulation was soon waived and full Nazi Party members served in the in particular after the outbreak of World War II. The Reserves also saw a high number of senior Nazis enlisting, with Reinhard Heydrich and Fritz Todt joining the , as well as Karl Hanke who served in the army.\nThe British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that junior officers in the army were inclined to be especially zealous National Socialists with a third of them having joined the Nazi Party by 1941. Reinforcing the work of the junior leaders were the National Socialist Leadership Guidance Officers, which were created with the purpose of indoctrinating the troops for the \"war of extermination\" against Soviet Russia. Among higher-ranking officers, 29% were NSDAP members by 1941.\nStudent membership.\nIn 1926, the party formed a special division to engage the student population, known as the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB). A group for university lecturers, the National Socialist German University Lecturers' League (NSDDB), also existed until July 1944.\nWomen membership.\nThe National Socialist Women's League was the women's organization of the party and by 1938 it had approximately 2 million members.\nMembership outside Germany.\nParty members who lived outside Germany were pooled into the (NSDAP/AO, \"Foreign Organization\"). The organisation was limited only to so-called \"Imperial Germans\" (citizens of the German Empire); and \"Ethnic Germans\" (), who did not hold German citizenship were not permitted to join.\nUnder Bene\u0161 decree No. 16/1945 Coll., in case of citizens of Czechoslovakia membership of the Nazi Party was punishable by between five and twenty years of imprisonment.\n\"Deutsche Gemeinschaft\".\n was a branch of the Nazi Party founded in 1919, created for Germans with status.

{"id": "21742", "revid": "14383484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21742", "title": "New Age", "text": "New Age is a range of spiritual or religious practices and beliefs which rapidly grew in Western society during the early 1970s. Its highly eclectic and unsystematic structure makes a precise definition difficult. Although many scholars consider it a religious movement, its adherents typically see it as spiritual or as unifying Mind-Body-Spirit, and rarely use the term \"New Age\" themselves. Scholars often call it the New Age movement, although others contest this term and suggest it is better seen as a \"milieu\" or \"zeitgeist\".\nAs a form of Western esotericism, the New Age drew heavily upon esoteric traditions such as the occultism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as Spiritualism, New Thought, and Theosophy. More immediately, it arose from mid-twentieth century influences such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement. Its exact origins remain contested, but it became a major movement in the 1970s, at which time it was centered largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded widely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular in the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term \"New Age\" was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.\nDespite its eclectic nature, the New Age has several main currents. Theologically, the New Age typically accepts a holistic form of divinity that pervades the universe, including human beings themselves, leading to a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly by channeling through a human intermediary. Typically viewing history as divided into spiritual ages, a common New Age belief is in a forgotten age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, declining into periods of increasing violence and spiritual degeneracy, which will now be remedied by the emergence of an Age of Aquarius, from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of alternative medicine, and an emphasis on unifying science with spirituality.\nThe dedication of New Agers varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from Christians as well as modern Pagan and Indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.\nDefinitions.\nThe New Age phenomenon has proved difficult to define, with much scholarly disagreement as to its scope. The scholars Steven J. Sutcliffe and Ingvild S\u00e6lid Gilhus have even suggested that it remains \"among the most disputed of categories in the study of religion\".\nThe scholar of religion Paul Heelas characterised the New Age as \"an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life\" that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of \"the same (or very similar) \"lingua franca\" to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be transformed.\" Similarly, the historian of religion Olav Hammer termed it \"a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs\" that have emerged since the late 1970s and are \"largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an \"air de famille\"\". According to Hammer, this New Age was a \"fluid and fuzzy cultic milieu\". The sociologist of religion Michael York described the New Age as \"an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities\" that are united by their \"expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential.\"\nThe scholar of religion Wouter Hanegraaff adopted a different approach by asserting that \"New Age\" was \"a \"label\" attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it\" and that as a result it \"means very different things to different people\". He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered \"a unified ideology or \"Weltanschauung\"\", although he believed that it could be considered a \"more or less unified 'movement'.\" Other scholars have suggested that the New Age is too diverse to be a singular \"movement\". The scholar of religion George D. Chryssides called it \"a counter-cultural \"Zeitgeist\"\", while the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was a milieu; Heelas and scholar of religion Linda Woodhead called it the \"holistic milieu\".\nThere is no central authority within the New Age phenomenon that can determine what counts as New Age and what does not. Many of those groups and individuals who could analytically be categorised as part of the New Age reject the term \"New Age\" in reference to themselves. Some even express active hostility to the term. Rather than terming themselves \"New Agers\", those involved in this milieu commonly describe themselves as spiritual \"seekers\", and some self-identify as a member of a different religious group, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Buddhism. In 2003 Sutcliffe observed that the use of the term \"New Age\" was \"optional, episodic and declining overall\", adding that among the very few individuals who did use it, they usually did so with qualification, for instance by placing it in quotation marks. Other academics, such as Sara MacKian, have argued that the sheer diversity of the New Age renders the term too problematic for scholars to use. MacKian proposed \"everyday spirituality\" as an alternate term.\nWhile acknowledging that \"New Age\" was a problematic term, the scholar of religion James R. Lewis stated that it remained a useful etic category for scholars to use because \"There exists no comparable term which covers all aspects of the movement.\" Similarly, Chryssides argued that the fact that \"New Age\" is a \"theoretical concept\" does not \"undermine its usefulness or employability\"; he drew comparisons with \"Hinduism\", a similar \"Western etic piece of vocabulary\" that scholars of religion used despite its problems.\nReligion, spirituality, and esotericism.\nIn discussing the New Age, academics have varyingly referred to \"New Age spirituality\" and \"New Age religion\". Those involved in the New Age rarely consider it to be \"religion\"\u2014negatively associating that term solely with organized religion\u2014and instead describe their practices as \"spirituality\". Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the New Age milieu as a \"religion\". York described the New Age as a new religious movement (NRM). Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation; Heelas believed that while elements of the New Age represented NRMs, this did not apply to every New Age group. Similarly, Chryssides stated that the New Age could not be seen as \"a religion\" in itself.\nThe New Age is also a form of Western esotericism. Hanegraaff regarded the New Age as a form of \"popular culture criticism\", in that it represented a reaction against the dominant Western values of Judeo-Christian religion and rationalism, adding that \"New Age religion formulates such criticism not at random, but falls back on\" the ideas of earlier Western esoteric groups.\nThe New Age has also been identified by various scholars of religion as part of the cultic milieu. This concept, developed by the sociologist Colin Campbell, refers to a social network of marginalised ideas. Through their shared marginalisation within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.\nHammer identified much of the New Age as corresponding to the concept of \"folk religions\" in that it seeks to deal with existential questions regarding subjects like death and disease in \"an unsystematic fashion, often through a process of bricolage from already available narratives and rituals\". York also heuristically divides the New Age into three broad trends. The first, the \"social camp\", represents groups that primarily seek to bring about social change, while the second, the \"occult camp\", instead focus on contact with spirit entities and channeling. York's third group, the \"spiritual camp\", represents a middle ground between these two camps that focuses largely on individual development.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"new age\", along with related terms like \"new era\" and \"new world\", long predate the emergence of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning. It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the Great Seal of the United States, designed in 1782, proclaims a \"new order of ages\", while in the 1980s the Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proclaimed that \"all mankind is entering a new age\". The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward. In 1864 the American Swedenborgian Warren Felt Evans published \"The New Age and its Message\", while in 1907 Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson began editing a weekly journal of Christian liberalism and socialism titled \"The New Age\". The concept of a coming \"new age\" that would be inaugurated by the return to Earth of Jesus Christ was a theme in the poetry of Wellesley Tudor Pole (1884-1968) and of Johanna Brandt (1876-1964), and then also appeared in the work of the British-born American Theosophist Alice Bailey (1880-1949), featuring prominently in such titles as \"Discipleship in the New Age\" (1944) and \"Education in the New Age\" (1954). Carl Jung frequently wrote of the \"new aeon/aion,\" denoting the shift from the \"Platonic month\" of Pisces to that of Aquarius.\nBetween the 1930s and 1960s a small number of groups and individuals became preoccupied with the concept of a coming \"New Age\" and prominently used the term accordingly. The term had thus become a recurring motif in the esoteric spirituality milieu.\nSutcliffe, therefore, expressed the view that while the term \"New Age\" had originally been an \"apocalyptic emblem\", it would only be later that it became \"a tag or codeword for a 'spiritual' idiom\".\nHistory.\nAntecedents.\nAccording to scholar Nevill Drury, the New Age has a \"tangible history\", although Hanegraaff expressed the view that most New Agers were \"surprisingly ignorant about the actual historical roots of their beliefs\". Similarly, Hammer thought that \"source amnesia\" was a \"building block of a New Age worldview\", with New Agers typically adopting ideas with no awareness of where those ideas originated.\nAs a form of Western esotericism, the New Age has antecedents that stretch back to southern Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed in response to the development of scientific rationality. Scholars call this new esoteric trend \"occultism\", and this occultism was a key factor in the development of the worldview from which the New Age emerged.\nOne of the earliest influences on the New Age was the Swedish 18th century Christian mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, who professed the ability to communicate with angels, demons, and spirits. Swedenborg's attempt to unite science and religion and his prediction of a coming era in particular have been cited as ways that he prefigured the New Age. Another early influence was the late 18th and early 19th century German physician and hypnotist Franz Mesmer, who claimed the existence of a force known as \"animal magnetism\" running through the human body. The establishment of Spiritualism, an occult religion influenced by both Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism, in the U.S. during the 1840s has also been identified as a precursor to the New Age, in particular through its rejection of established Christianity, its claims to representing a scientific approach to religion, and its emphasis on channeling spirit entities.\nA further major influence on the New Age was the Theosophical Society, an occult group co-founded by the Russian Helena Blavatsky in the late 19th century. In her books \"Isis Unveiled\" (1877) and \"The Secret Doctrine\" (1888), Blavatsky claimed that her Society was conveying the essence of all world religions, and it thus emphasized a focus on comparative religion. Serving as a partial bridge between Theosophical ideas and those of the New Age was the American esotericist Edgar Cayce, who founded the Association for Research and Enlightenment. Another partial bridge was the Danish mystic Martinus who is popular in Scandinavia.\nAnother influence was New Thought, which developed in late nineteenth century New England as a Christian-oriented healing movement before spreading throughout the United States. Another prominent influence was the psychologist Carl Jung.\nDrury also identified as an important influence upon the New Age the Indian Swami Vivekananda, an adherent of the philosophy of Vedanta who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.\nHanegraaff believed that the New Age's direct antecedents could be found in the UFO religions of the 1950s, which he termed a \"proto-New Age movement\". Many of these new religious movements had strong apocalyptic beliefs regarding a coming new age, which they typically asserted would be brought about by contact with extraterrestrials. Examples of such groups included the Aetherius Society, founded in the UK in 1955, and the Heralds of the New Age, established in New Zealand in 1956.\n1960s.\nFrom a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is most associated with the counterculture of the 1960s. According to author Andrew Grant Jackson, George Harrison's adoption of Hindu philosophy and Indian instrumentation in his songs with the Beatles in the mid-1960s, together with the band's highly publicised study of Transcendental Meditation, \"truly kick-started\" the Human Potential Movement that subsequently became New Age. Although not common throughout the counterculture, usage of the terms \"New Age\" and \"Age of Aquarius\"\u2014used in reference to a coming era\u2014were found within it, for instance appearing on adverts for the Woodstock festival of 1969, and in the lyrics of \"Aquarius\", the opening song of the 1967 musical \"Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical\".\nThis decade also witnessed the emergence of a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism, which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. Esalen and similar personal growth centers had developed links to humanistic psychology, and from this, the human potential movement emerged, strongly influenced the New Age.\nIn Britain, a number of small religious groups that came to be identified as the \"light\" movement had begun declaring the existence of a coming new age, influenced strongly by the Theosophical ideas of Blavatsky and Bailey. The most prominent of these groups was the Findhorn Foundation, which founded the Findhorn Ecovillage in the Scottish area of Findhorn, Moray in 1962. Although its founders were from an older generation, Findhorn attracted increasing numbers of countercultural baby boomers during the 1960s, to the extent that its population had grown sixfold to c. 120 residents by 1972. In October 1965, the co-founder of Findhorn Foundation, Peter Caddy, a former member of the occult Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, attended a meeting of various prominent figures within Britain's esoteric milieu; advertised as \"The Significance of the Group in the New Age\", it was held at Attingham Park over the course of a weekend.\nAll of these groups created the backdrop from which the New Age movement emerged. As James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton point out, the New Age phenomenon represents \"a synthesis of many different preexisting movements and strands of thought\". Nevertheless, York asserted that while the New Age bore many similarities with both earlier forms of Western esotericism and Asian religion, it remained \"distinct from its predecessors in its own self-consciousness as a new way of thinking\".\nEmergence and development: c. 1970\u20132000.\nBy the early 1970s, use of the term \"New Age\" was increasingly common within the cultic milieu. This was because\u2014according to Sutcliffe\u2014the \"emblem\" of the \"New Age\" had been passed from the \"subcultural pioneers\" in groups like Findhorn to the wider array of \"countercultural baby boomers\" between c. 1967 and 1974. He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term \"New Age\" changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities and practices. In the latter part of the 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but were nevertheless widely recognised as broadly similar in their search for \"alternatives\" to mainstream society. In doing so, the \"New Age\" became a banner under which to bring together the wider \"cultic milieu\" of American society.\nThe counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement, but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.\nThe exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s, whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s. This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from Theosophy and Anthroposophy. Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the \"New Age sensu stricto\", or \"New Age in the strict sense\".\nHanegraaff terms the broader development the \"New Age sensu lato\", or \"New Age in the wider sense\". Stores that came to be known as \"New Age shops\" opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewellery, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as \"New Age bookstores\", while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream bookstores and then websites like Amazon.com.\nNot everyone who came to be associated with the New Age phenomenon openly embraced the term \"New Age\", although it was popularised in books like David Spangler's 1977 work \"Revelation: The Birth of a New Age\" and Mark Satin's 1979 book \"New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society\". Marilyn Ferguson's 1982 book \"The Aquarian Conspiracy\" has also been regarded as a landmark work in the development of the New Age, promoting the idea that a new era was emerging. Other terms that were employed synonymously with \"New Age\" in this milieu included \"Green\", \"Holistic\", \"Alternative\", and \"Spiritual\".\n1971 witnessed the foundation of est by Werner H. Erhard, a transformational training course that became a prominent part of the early movement. Melton suggested that the 1970s witnessed the growth of a relationship between the New Age movement and the older New Thought movement, as evidenced by the widespread use of Helen Schucman's \"A Course in Miracles\" (1975), New Age music, and crystal healing in New Thought churches. Some figures in the New Thought movement were skeptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives. During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of pilgrimage for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.\nSeveral key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: publication of Linda Goodman's best-selling astrology books \"Sun Signs\" (1968) and \"Love Signs\" (1978); the release of Shirley MacLaine's book \"Out on a Limb\" (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the \"Harmonic Convergence\" planetary alignment on August 16 and 17, 1987, organized by Jos\u00e9 Arg\u00fcelles in Sedona, Arizona. The Convergence attracted more people to the movement than any other single event. Heelas suggested that the movement was influenced by the \"enterprise culture\" encouraged by the U.S. and U.K. governments during the 1980s onward, with its emphasis on initiative and self-reliance resonating with any New Age ideas.\nThe claims of channelers Jane Roberts (Seth Material), Helen Schucman (\"A Course in Miracles\"), J. Z. Knight (Ramtha), Neale Donald Walsch (\"Conversations with God\") (note that Walsch denies being a \"channeler\" and his books make it obvious that he is not one, though the text emerged through a dialogue with a deeper part of himself in a process comparable to automatic writing) contributed to the movement's growth. The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as Ram Dass. Core works in the propagating New Age ideas included Jane Roberts's Seth series, published from 1972 onward, Helen Schucman's 1975 publication \"A Course in Miracles\", and James Redfield's 1993 work \"The Celestine Prophecy\". A variety of these books were best sellers, with the Seth book series for instance selling over a million copies. Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites. The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.\nNew Age ideas influenced the development of rave culture in the late 1980s and 1990s. In Britain during the 1980s, the term \"New Age Travellers\" came into use, although York characterised this term as \"a misnomer created by the media\". These New Age Travellers had little to do with the New Age as the term was used more widely, with scholar of religion Daren Kemp observing that \"New Age spirituality is not an essential part of New Age Traveller culture, although there are similarities between the two worldviews\". The term \"New Age\" came to be used increasingly widely by the popular media in the 1990s.\nDecline or transformation?: 1990\u2013present.\nBy the late 1980s, some publishers dropped the term \"New Age\" as a marketing device. In 1994, the scholar of religion Gordon J. Melton presented a conference paper in which he argued that, given that he knew of nobody describing their practices as \"New Age\" anymore, the New Age had died. In 2001, Hammer observed that the term \"New Age\" had increasingly been rejected as either pejorative or meaningless by individuals within the Western cultic milieu. He also noted that within this milieu it was not being replaced by any alternative and that as such a sense of collective identity was being lost.\nOther scholars disagreed with Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that \"New Age is still very much alive\". Hammer himself stated that \"the New Age \"movement\" may be on the wane, but the wider New Age \"religiosity\"... shows no sign of disappearing\". MacKian suggested that the New Age \"movement\" had been replaced by a wider \"New Age sentiment\" which had come to pervade \"the socio-cultural landscape\" of Western countries. Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high-profile figures: U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer, British Princess Diana visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise established a school devoted to communicating with angels.\nNew Age shops continued to operate, although many have been remarketed as \"Mind, Body, Spirit\".\nIn 2015, the scholar of religion Hugh Urban argued that New Age spirituality is growing in the United States and can be expected to become more visible: \"According to many recent surveys of religious affiliation, the 'spiritual but not religious' category is one of the fastest-growing trends in American culture, so the New Age attitude of spiritual individualism and eclecticism may well be an increasingly visible one in the decades to come\".\nAustralian scholar Paul J. Farrelly, in his 2017 doctoral dissertation at Australian National University, argued that, while the term New Age may become less popular in the West, it is actually booming in Taiwan, where it is regarded as something comparatively new and is being exported from Taiwan to the Mainland China, where it is more or less tolerated by the authorities.\nBeliefs and practices.\nEclecticism and self-spirituality.\nThe New Age places strong emphasis on the idea that the individual and their own experiences are the primary source of authority on spiritual matters. It exhibits what Heelas termed \"unmediated individualism\", and reflects a world-view that is \"radically democratic\". It places an emphasis on the freedom and autonomy of the individual. This emphasis has led to ethical disagreements; some New Agers believe helping others is beneficial, although another view is that doing so encourages dependency and conflicts with a reliance on the self. Nevertheless, within the New Age, there are differences in the role accorded to voices of authority outside of the self. Hammer stated that \"a belief in the existence of a core or true Self\" is a \"recurring theme\" in New Age texts. The concept of \"personal growth\" is also greatly emphasised among New Agers, while Heelas noted that \"for participants spirituality \"is\" life-itself\".\nNew Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism. Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality, New Agers develop their own worldview \"by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix\", seeking what Drury called \"a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas\". The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that \"any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative\". This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents \"supermarket spirituality\". York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within late modern capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.\nAs part of its eclecticism, the New Age draws ideas from many different cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to \"a very vague claim\" about underlying global unity. Certain societies are more usually chosen over others; examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the Essenes, Atlanteans, and ancient extraterrestrials. As noted by Hammer: \"to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians are not part of our cultural stereotypes\". According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic \"Other\" for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.\nTheology, cosmogony, and cosmology.\nA belief in divinity is integral to New Age ideas, although understandings of this divinity vary. New Age theology exhibits an inclusive and universalistic approach that accepts all personal perspectives on the divine as equally valid. This intentional vagueness as to the nature of divinity also reflects the New Age idea that divinity cannot be comprehended by the human mind or language. New Age literature nevertheless displays recurring traits in its depiction of the divine: the first is the idea that it is holistic, thus frequently being described with such terms as an \"Ocean of Oneness\", \"Infinite Spirit\", \"Primal Stream\", \"One Essence\", and \"Universal Principle\". A second trait is the characterisation of divinity as \"Mind\", \"Consciousness\", and \"Intelligence\", while a third is the description of divinity as a form of \"energy\". A fourth trait is the characterisation of divinity as a \"life force\", the essence of which is creativity, while a fifth is the concept that divinity consists of love.\nMost New Age groups believe in an Ultimate Source from which all things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine. Various creation myths have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it. In contrast, some New Agers emphasize the idea of a universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source. The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole, in doing so rejecting both the dualism of the Christian division of matter and spirit and the reductionism of Cartesian science. A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock. The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as \"droplet of divinity\", \"inner Godhead\", and \"divine self\". Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding 'subtle bodies', a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a \"Higher Self\" that is a part of the human but connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through intuition.\nCosmogonical creation stories are common in New Age sources, with these accounts reflecting the movement's holistic framework by describing an original, primal oneness from which all things in the universe emanated. An additional common theme is that human souls\u2014once living in a spiritual world\u2014then descended into a world of matter.\nThe New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms. This physical world is hence seen as \"a domain for learning and growth\" after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence. There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than Darwinian evolution, this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal or an open-ended, creative evolution.\nSpirit and channeling.\nMacKian argued that a central, but often overlooked, element of the phenomenon was an emphasis on \"spirit\", and in particular participants' desire for a relationship with spirit. Many practitioners in her UK-focused study described themselves as \"workers \"for\" spirit\", expressing the desire to help people learn about spirit. They understood various material signs as marking the presence of spirit, for instance, the unexpected appearance of a feather. New Agers often call upon this spirit to assist them in everyday situations, for instance, to ease the traffic flow on their way to work.\nNew Age literature often refers to benevolent non-human spirit-beings who are interested in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, guardian angels, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts. New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors. The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.\nAlthough not present in every New Age group, a core belief within the milieu is in channeling. This is the idea that humans beings, sometimes (although not always) in a state of trance, can act \"as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves\". These sources are varyingly described as being God, gods and goddesses, ascended masters, spirit guides, extraterrestrials, angels, devas, historical figures, the collective unconscious, elementals, or nature spirits. Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of \"articulated revelation\", and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.\nProminent examples of New Age channeling include Jane Roberts' claims that she was contacted by an entity called Seth, and Helen Schucman's claims to have channeled Jesus Christ. The academic Suzanne Riordan examined a variety of these New Age channeled messages, noting that they typically \"echoed each other in tone and content\", offering an analysis of the human condition and giving instructions or advice for how humanity can discover its true destiny.\nFor many New Agers, these channeled messages rival the scriptures of the main world religions as sources of spiritual authority, although often New Agers describe historical religious revelations as forms of \"channeling\" as well, thus attempting to legitimate and authenticate their own contemporary practices. Although the concept of channeling from discarnate spirit entities has links to Spiritualism and psychical research, the New Age does not feature Spiritualism's emphasis on proving the existence of life after death, nor psychical research's focus of testing mediums for consistency.\nAstrological cycles and the Age of Aquarius.\nNew Age thought typically envisions the world as developing through cosmological cycles that can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived in an age of spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts. New Age literature often posits that the ancient period of spiritual wisdom gave way to an age of spiritual decline, sometimes termed the Age of Pisces. Although characterised as being a negative period for humanity, New Age literature views the Age of Pisces as an important learning experience for the species. Hanegraaff stated that New Age perceptions of history were \"extremely sketchy\" in their use of description, reflecting little interest in historiography and conflating history with myth. He also noted that they were highly ethnocentric in placing Western civilization at the centre of historical development.\nA common belief among the New Age is that humanity has entered, or is coming to enter, a new period known as the Age of Aquarius, which Melton has characterised as a \"New Age of love, joy, peace, abundance, and harmony[...] the Golden Age heretofore only dreamed about.\" In accepting this belief in a coming new age, the milieu has been described as \"highly positive, celebratory, [and] utopian\", and has also been cited as an apocalyptic movement. Opinions about the nature of the coming Age of Aquarius differ among New Agers. There are for instance differences in belief about its commencement; New Age author David Spangler claimed that it began in 1967, others placed its beginning with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987, author Jos\u00e9 Arg\u00fcelles predicted its start in 2012, and some believe that it will not begin until several centuries into the third millennium.\nThere are also differences in how this new age is envisioned. Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the \"moderate\" perspective believed that it would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns\u2014through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine\u2014to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation. Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an \"Age of Light\", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness. Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.\nThere are various beliefs within the milieu as to how this new age will come about, but most emphasise the idea that it will be established through human agency; others assert that it will be established with the aid of non-human forces such as spirits or extraterrestrials. Ferguson, for instance, claimed that there was a vanguard of humans known as the \"Aquarian conspiracy\" who were helping to bring the Age of Aquarius forth through their actions. Participants in the New Age typically express the view that their own spiritual actions are helping to bring about the Age of Aquarius, with writers like Ferguson and Arg\u00fcelles presenting themselves as prophets ushering forth this future era.\nHealing and alternative medicine.\nAnother recurring element of New Age is an emphasis on healing and alternative medicine. The general New Age ethos is that health is the natural state for the human being and that illness is a disruption of that natural balance. Hence, New Age therapies seek to heal \"illness\" as a general concept that includes physical, mental, and spiritual aspects; in doing so it critiques mainstream Western medicine for simply attempting to cure disease, and thus has an affinity with most forms of traditional medicine. Its focus of self-spirituality has led to the emphasis of self-healing, although also present are ideas on healing both others and the Earth itself.\nThe healing elements of the movement are difficult to classify given that a variety of terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things. However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the Human Potential Movement, which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life. Hanegraaff described transpersonal psychology as the \"theoretical wing\" of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of altered states of consciousness. Closely connected to this is the shamanic consciousness current, which argues that the shaman was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.\nHanegraaff identified the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This emerged in the 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises the idea that the human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, with some of the most common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, applied kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy, iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. Although the use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age, this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.\nThe mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler's ethnographic description of \"Angel therapy\" in Ireland.\nNew Age science.\nAccording to Drury, the New Age attempts to create \"a worldview that includes both science and spirituality\", while Hess noted how New Agers have \"a penchant for bringing together the technical and the spiritual, the scientific and the religious\".\nAlthough New Agers typically reject rationalism, the scientific method, and the academic establishment, they employ terminology and concepts borrowed from science and particularly from the New Physics. Moreover, a number of prominent influences on New Age, such as David Bohm and Ilya Prigogine, had backgrounds as professional scientists. Hanegraaff identified \"New Age science\" as a form of \"Naturphilosophie\".\nIn this, the milieu is interested in developing unified world views to discover the nature of the divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement\u2014most notably Fritjof Capra in his \"The Tao of Physics\" (1975) and Gary Zukav in \"The Dancing Wu Li Masters\" (1979)\u2014have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.\nDespite New Agers' appeals to science, most of the academic and scientific establishments dismiss \"New Age science\" as pseudo-science, or at best existing in part on the fringes of genuine scientific research. This is an attitude also shared by many active in the field of parapsychology. In turn, New Agers often accuse the scientific establishment of pursuing a dogmatic and outmoded approach to scientific enquiry, believing that their own understandings of the universe will replace those of the academic establishment in a paradigm shift.\nEthics and afterlife.\nThere is no ethical cohesion within the New Age phenomenon, although Hanegraaff argued that the central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential. Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic good and evil, negative events that happen are interpreted not as the result of evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.\nIt rejects the Christian emphasis on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that if an individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead, the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.\nAccording to Hanegraaff, the question of death and afterlife is not a \"pressing problem requiring an answer\" in the New Age. A belief in reincarnation is very common, where it often viewed as being part of an individual's progressive spiritual evolution toward realisation of their own divinity. In New Age literature, the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self-evident, with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others, although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice. Many New Agers believe in karma, treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.\nIn much New Age literature on reincarnation, it is claimed that part of the human soul, that which carries the personality, perishes with the death of the body, while the Higher Self\u2014that which connects with divinity\u2014survives in order to be reborn into another body. It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born, in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution. Prominent New Age writers like Shakti Gawain and Louise Hay therefore express the view that humans are responsible for the events that happen to them during their life, an idea that many New Agers regard as empowering. At times, past life regression are employed within the New Age in order to reveal a Higher Soul's previous incarnations, usually with an explicit healing purpose. Some practitioners espouse the idea of a \"soul group\" or \"soul family\", a group of connected souls who reincarnate together as family of friendship units. Rather than reincarnation, another afterlife belief found among New Agers holds that an individual's soul returns to a \"universal energy\" on bodily death.\nDemographics.\nIn the mid-1990s, the New Age was found primarily in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as \"New Agers\" renders it difficult to determine the total number of practitioners. Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the New Age. He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas. Between 2000 and 2002, Heelas and Woodhead conducted research into the New Age in the English town of Kendal, Cumbria; they found 600 people actively attended New Age activities on a weekly basis, representing 1.6% of the town's population. From this, they extrapolated that around 900,000 Britons regularly took part in New Age activities. In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown to such an extent that they were \"increasingly rivaling the sway of Christianity in Western settings\".\nSociological investigation indicates that certain sectors of society are more likely to engage in New Age practices than others. In the United States, the first people to embrace the New Age belonged to the baby boomer generation, those born between 1946 and 1964.\nSutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male, approximately two-thirds of its participants were female. Heelas and Woodhead's Kendal Project found that of those regularly attending New Age activities in the town, 80% were female, while 78% of those running such activities were female. They attributed this female dominance to \"deeply entrenched cultural values and divisions of labour\" in Western society, according to which women were accorded greater responsibility for the well-being of others, thus making New Age practices more attractive to them. They suggested that men were less attracted to New Age activities because they were hampered by a \"masculinist ideal of autonomy and self-sufficiency\" which discouraged them from seeking the assistance of others for their inner development.\nThe majority of New Agers are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society. Heelas and Woodhead found that of the active Kendal New Agers, 57% had a university or college degree. Their Kendal Project also determined that 73% of active New Agers were aged over 45, and 55% were aged between 40 and 59; it also determined that many got involved while middle-aged. Comparatively few were either young or elderly. Heelas and Woodhead suggested that the dominance of middle-aged people, particularly women, was because at this stage of life they had greater time to devote to their own inner development, with their time previously having been dominated by raising children. They also suggested that middle-aged people were experiencing more age-related ailments than the young, and thus more keen to pursue New Age activities to improve their health.\nHeelas added that within the baby boomers, the movement had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele. He typified the typical New Ager as someone who was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to those who believe that modernity is in crisis. He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self. He believed that many individuals had been \"culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer\", with the New Age attracting \"expressive\" people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus. It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community. He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of religious conversion, others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion. Sutcliffe described the \"typical\" participant in the New Age milieu as being \"a religious individualist, mixing and matching cultural resources in an animated spiritual quest\".\nThe degree to which individuals are involved in the New Age varies. Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of \"serious part-timers\" who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of \"casual part-timers\" who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life. MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are \"consultative\" practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are \"serious\" practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are \"non-practitioner consumers\", individuals affected by the general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them. Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll, for instance, revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.\nIn 1995, Kyle stated that on the whole, New Agers in the United States preferred the values of the Democratic Party over those of the Republican Party. He added that most New Agers \"soundly rejected\" the agenda of former Republican President Ronald Reagan.\nSocial communities.\nMacKian suggested that this phenomenon was \"an inherently \"social\" mode of spirituality\", one which cultivated a sense of belonging among its participants and encouraged relations both with other humans and with non-human, otherworldly spirit entities.\nMacKian suggested that these communities \"may look very different\" from those of traditional religious groups.\nOnline connections were one of the ways that interested individuals met new contacts and established networks.\nCommercial aspects.\nSome New Agers advocate living in a simple and sustainable manner to reduce humanity's impact on the natural resources of Earth; and they shun consumerism. The New Age movement has been centered around rebuilding a sense of community to counter social disintegration; this has been attempted through the formation of intentional communities, where individuals come together to live and work in a communal lifestyle. New Age centres have been set up in various parts of the world, representing an institutionalised form of the movement. Notable examples include the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Holly Hock Farm near to Vancouver, the Wrekin Trust in West Malvern, Worcestershire, and the Skyros Centre in Skyros. Criticising mainstream Western education as counterproductive to the ethos of the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools for the education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.\nBruce argued that in seeking to \"denying the validity of externally imposed controls and privileging the divine within\", the New Age sought to dismantle pre-existing social order, but that it failed to present anything adequate in its place. Heelas, however, cautioned that Bruce had arrived at this conclusion based on \"flimsy evidence\", and Aldred argued that only a minority of New Agers participate in community-focused activities; instead, she claimed, the majority of New Agers participate mainly through the purchase of books and products targeted at the New Age market, positioning New Age as a primarily consumerist and commercial movement.\nFairs and festivals.\nNew Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, fairs, and festivals.\nNew Age fairs\u2014sometimes known as \"Mind, Body, Spirit fairs\", \"psychic fairs\", or \"alternative health fairs\"\u2014are spaces in which a variety of goods and services are displayed by different vendors, including forms of alternative medicine and esoteric practices such as palmistry or tarot card reading. A prominent example is the Mind Body Spirit Festival, held annually in the United Kingdom, at which\u2014the religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge noted\u2014one could encounter \"a wide range of beliefs and practices from crystal healing to ... Kirlian photography to psychic art, from angels to past-life therapy, from Theosophy to UFO religion, and from New Age music to the vegetarianism of Suma Chign Hai.\" Similar festivals are held across Europe and in Australia and the United States.\nApproaches to financial prosperity and business.\nA number of New Age proponents have emphasised the use of spiritual techniques as a tool for attaining financial prosperity, thus moving the movement away from its counter-cultural origins. Commenting on this \"New Age capitalism\", Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the petty bourgeoisie, rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations. The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself is little more than a manifestation of consumerism. This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.\nEmbracing this attitude, various books have been published espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses. During the 1980s, many prominent U.S. corporations\u2014among them IBM, AT&amp;T, and General Motors\u2014embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their workforce, although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, claiming that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health. However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining profit has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement, with prominent New Agers such as Spangler and Matthew Fox criticising what they see as trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience. In particular, the movement's commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, \"a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and capitalistic private enterprise\".\nGiven that it encourages individuals to choose spiritual practices on the grounds of personal preference and thus encourages them to behave as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.\nMusic.\nThe term \"new-age music\" is applied, sometimes in a derogative manner, to forms of ambient music, a genre that developed in the 1960s and was popularised in the 1970s, particularly with the work of Brian Eno. The genre's relaxing nature resulted in it becoming popular within New Age circles, with some forms of the genre having a specifically New Age orientation. Studies have determined that new-age music can be an effective component of stress management.\nThe style began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the ECM label; such as Oregon, the Paul Winter Consort, and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician Daniel Kobialka, and the psychoacoustic \"environments\" recordings of Irv Teibel. In the early 1970s, it was mostly instrumental with both acoustic and electronic styles. New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic space music using synthesizers and acoustic instrumentals using Native American flutes and drums, singing bowls, Australian didgeridoos and world music sounds to spiritual chanting from other cultures.\nPolitics.\nWhile many commentators have focused on the spiritual and cultural aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s. The sociologist of religion Steven Bruce noted that the New Age provides ideas on how to deal with \"our socio-psychological problems\". Scholar of religion James R. Lewis observed that, despite the common caricature of New Agers as narcissistic, \"significant numbers\" of them were \"trying to make the planet a better place on which to live,\" and scholar J. Gordon Melton's \"New Age Encyclopedia\" (1990) included an entry called \"New Age politics\". Some New Agers have entered the political system in an attempt to advocate for the societal transformation that the New Age promotes.\nIdeas.\nAlthough New Age activists have been motivated by New Age concepts like holism, interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse, ranging from far-right and conservative through to liberal, socialist, and libertarian. Accordingly, Kyle stated that \"New Age politics is difficult to describe and categorize. The standard political labels\u2014left or right, liberal or conservative\u2014miss the mark.\" MacKian suggested that the New Age operated as a form of \"world-realigning infrapolitics\" that undermines the disenchantment of modern Western society.\nThe extent to which New Age spokespeople mix religion and politics varies. New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as \"fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete\". The New Ager Mark Satin for instance spoke of \"New Age politics\" as a politically radical \"third force\" that was \"neither left nor right\". He believed that in contrast to the conventional political focus on the \"institutional and economic symptoms\" of society's problems, his \"New Age politics\" would focus on \"psychocultural roots\" of these issues. Ferguson regarded New Age politics as \"a kind of Radical Centre\", one that was \"not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road.\" Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the \"Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm\". In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological \"systems view\" of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues. Corinne McLaughlin argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new \"spiritual politics\" could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.\nMany New Agers advocate globalisation and localisation, but reject nationalism and the role of the nation-state. Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government. Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions that, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity. Benjamin Creme conversely argued that \"the Christ,\" a great Avatar, Maitreya, the World Teacher, expected by all the major religions as their \"Awaited One,\" would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the United Nations; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy. Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of democracy and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of representative democracy and majority rule, thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.\nGroups.\nScholars have noted several New Age political groups. Self-Determination: A Personal/Political Network, lauded by Ferguson and Satin, was described at length by sociology of religion scholar Steven Tipton. Founded in 1975 by California state legislator John Vasconcellos and others, it encouraged Californians to engage in personal growth work and political activities at the same time, especially at the grassroots level. Hanegraaff noted another California-based group, the Institute of Noetic Sciences, headed by the author Willis Harman. It advocated a change in consciousness\u2014in \"basic underlying assumptions\"\u2014in order to come to grips with global crises. Kyle said that the New York City-based Planetary Citizens organization, headed by United Nations consultant and \"Earth at Omega\" author Donald Keys, sought to implement New Age political ideas.\nScholar J. Gordon Melton and colleagues focused on the New World Alliance, a Washington, DC-based organization founded in 1979 by Mark Satin and others. According to Melton et al., the Alliance tried to combine left- and right-wing ideas as well as personal growth work and political activities. Group decision-making was facilitated by short periods of silence. Sponsors of the Alliance's national political newsletter included Willis Harman and John Vasconcellos. Scholar James R. Lewis counted \"Green politics\" as one of the New Age's more visible activities. One academic book claims that the U.S. Green Party movement began as an initiative of a handful of activists including Charlene Spretnak, co-author of a \"'new age' interpretation\" of the German Green movement (Capra and Spretnak's \"Green Politics\"), and Mark Satin, author of \"New Age Politics\". Another academic publication says Spretnak and Satin largely co-drafted the U.S. Greens' founding document, the \"Ten Key Values\" statement.\nIn the 21st century.\nWhile the term \"New Age\" may have fallen out of favor, scholar George Chryssides notes that the New Age by whatever name is \"still alive and active\" in the 21st century. In the realm of politics, New Ager Mark Satin's book \"Radical Middle\" (2004) reached out to mainstream liberals. York (2005) identified \"key New Age spokespeople\" including William Bloom, Satish Kumar, and Starhawk who were emphasizing a link between spirituality and environmental consciousness. Former Esalen Institute staffer Stephen Dinan's \"Sacred America, Sacred World\" (2016) prompted a long interview of Dinan in \"Psychology Today\", which called the book a \"manifesto for our country's evolution that is both political and deeply spiritual\".\nIn 2013 longtime New Age author Marianne Williamson launched a campaign for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, telling \"The New York Times\" that her type of spirituality was what American politics needed. \"America has swerved from its ethical center\", she said. Running as an independent in west Los Angeles, she finished fourth in her district's open primary election with 13% of the vote. In early 2019, Williamson announced her candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination for president of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election. A 5,300-word article about her presidential campaign in \"The Washington Post\" said she had \"plans to fix America with love. Tough love\". In January 2020 she withdrew her bid for the nomination.\nReception.\nPopular media.\nMainstream periodicals tended to be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book \"The Cultural Creatives\", what they called the media's \"zest for attacking\" New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 Lance Morrow essay in \"Time\" magazine. Nearly a decade earlier, \"Time\" had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a headshot of a famous actress beside the headline, \"Om... THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore\". The story itself, by former \"Saturday Evening Post\" editor Otto Friedrich, was sub-titled, \"A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country\". In 1988, the magazine \"The New Republic\" ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by a journalist Richard Blow entitled simply, \"Moronic Convergence\".\nSome New Agers and New Age sympathizers responded to such criticisms. For example, sympathizers Ray and Anderson said that much of it was an attempt to \"stereotype\" the movement for idealistic and spiritual change, and to cut back on its popularity. New Age theoretician David Spangler tried to distance himself from what he called the \"New Age glamour\" of crystals, talk-show channelers, and other easily commercialized phenomena, and sought to underscore his commitment to the New Age as a vision of genuine social transformation.\nAcademia.\nInitially, academic interest in the New Age was minimal. The earliest academic studies of the New Age phenomenon were performed by specialists in the study of new religious movements such as Robert Ellwood. This research was often scanty because many scholars regarded the New Age as an insignificant cultural fad. Having been influenced by the U.S. anti-cult movement, much of it was also largely negative and critical of New Age groups. The \"first truly scholarly study\" of the phenomenon was an edited volume put together by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton in 1992. From that point on, the number of published academic studies steadily increased.\nIn 1994, Christoph Bochinger published his study of the New Age in Germany, \"\"New Age\" und moderne Religion\". This was followed by Michael York's sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle's U.S.-focused work in 1995. In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business. That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published \"New Age Religion and Western Culture\", a historical analysis of New Age texts; Hammer later described it as having \"a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age\". Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an ethnographic analysis of its practitioners.\nSutcliffe and Gilhus argued that 'New Age studies' could be seen as having experienced two waves; in the first, scholars focused on \"macro-level analyses of the content and boundaries\" of the \"movement\", while the second wave featured \"more variegated and contextualized studies of particular beliefs and practices\". Sutcliffe and Gilhus have also expressed concern that, as of 2013, 'New Age studies' has yet to formulate a set of research questions scholars can pursue.\nThe New Age has proved a challenge for scholars of religion operating under more formative models of what \"religion\" is. By 2006, Heelas noted that the New Age was so vast and diverse that no scholar of the subject could hope to keep up with all of it.\nChristian perspectives.\nMainstream Christianity has typically rejected the ideas of the New Age; Christian critiques often emphasise that the New Age places the human individual before God. Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that influenced British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the New Age; a number propagated conspiracy theories regarding its origin and purpose. The most successful such publication was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel \"This Present Darkness\", which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with feminism and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.\nOfficial responses to the New Age have been produced by major Christian organisations like the Roman Catholic Church, Church of England, and Methodist Church.\nThe Roman Catholic Church published \"A Christian reflection on the New Age\" in 2003, following a six-year study; the 90-page document criticizes New Age practices such as yoga, meditation, feng shui, and crystal healing. According to the Vatican, euphoric states attained through New Age practices should not be confused with prayer or viewed as signs of God's presence. Cardinal Paul Poupard, then-president of the Pontifical Council for culture, said the \"New Age is a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man\". Monsignor Michael Fitzgerald, then-president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, stated at the Vatican conference on the document: the \"Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age\". There are also other Christian groups that have adopted a more positive view of the New Age, among them the Christaquarians, and Christians Awakening to a New Awareness, all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person's Christian faith.\nContemporary Pagan perspectives.\nThere is academic debate about the connection between the New Age and Modern Paganism, sometimes termed \"Neo-paganism\". The two phenomena have often been confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques. Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a \"significant overlap\" between the two religious movements, while Aidan A. Kelly stated that Paganism \"parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways\". Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena that share overlap and commonalities. Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement\u2014particularly those that pre-dated the movement\u2014other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age. Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of occulture (occult culture) that merge at points.\nVarious differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past. Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a universalist message that sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas Paganism stresses the difference between monotheistic religions and those embracing a polytheistic or animistic theology. While the New Age emphasises a light-centred image, Paganism acknowledges both light and dark, life and death, and recognises the savage side of the natural world. Many Pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using \"New Age\" as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of Paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual. Many Pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the Pagan movement, with some Pagans pronouncing the word \"newage\" to rhyme with \"sewage\".\nNon-Western and Indigenous criticism.\nNew Age often adopts spiritual ideas and practices from other, particularly non-Western cultures. These may include \"Hawaiian Kahuna magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian \"ayahuasca\" and \"San Pedro\" ceremony, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, Chinese Feng Shui, Qi Gong, and Tai Chi\"\nThe New Age has been accused of cultural imperialism, misappropriating the sacred ceremonies, and exploitation of the intellectual and cultural property of Indigenous peoples. Indigenous American spiritual leaders, such as Elders councils of the Lakota, Cheyenne, Navajo, Creek, Hopi, Chippewa, and Haudenosaunee have denounced New Age misappropriation of their sacred ceremonies and other intellectual property, stating that \"[t]he value of these instructions and ceremonies [when led by unauthorized people] are questionable, maybe meaningless, and hurtful to the individual carrying false messages\". Traditional leaders of the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota peoples have reached consensus to reject \"the expropriation of [their] ceremonial ways by non-Indians\". They see the New Age movement as either not fully understanding, deliberately trivializing, or distorting their way of life, and have declared war on all such \"plastic medicine people\" who are appropriating their spiritual ways.\nIndigenous leaders have spoken out against individuals from within their own communities who may go out into the world to become a \"white man's shaman,\" and any \"who are prostituting our spiritual ways for their own selfish gain, with no regard for the spiritual well-being of the people as a whole\". The term \"plastic shaman\" or \"plastic medicine people\" has been applied to outsiders who identify themselves as shamans, holy people, or other traditional spiritual leaders, but who have no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures they claim to represent.\nPolitical writers and activists.\nToward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society. In 1987, some political scientists launched the \"Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics\" of the American Political Science Association, and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the \"transformational politics\" concept was meant to subsume such terms as \"new age\" and \"new paradigm\". In 1991, scholar of cultural studies Andrew Ross suggested that New Age political ideas\u2014however muddled and na\u00efve\u2014could help progressives construct an appealing alternative to both atomistic individualism and self-denying collectivism. In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to pay more attention to the New Age's interest in such topics as \"new socio-political thinking\" and \"New Economics\", topics Rose discussed in his book \"Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus\", issued by a European academic publisher.\nOther political thinkers and activists saw New Age politics less positively. On the political right, author George Weigel argued that New Age politics was just a retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism. Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham and Kemp, warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government. On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change. One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the reality of economic and political power. Another academic, Dana L. Cloud, wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology; she faulted it for not being opposed to the capitalist system, or to liberal individualism.\nA criticism of New Age often made by leftists is that its focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism. This perspective regards New Age as a manifestation of consumerism that promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies. New Agers who do engage in socio-political activism have also been criticized. Journalist Harvey Wasserman suggested that New Age activists were too averse to social conflict to be effective politically. Melton et al. found that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making led to \"extended meetings and minimal results\", and a pair of futurists concluded that one once-promising New Age activist group had been both \"too visionary and too vague\" to last."}

{"id": "21745", "revid": "44800074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21745", "title": "Naoko Takeuchi", "text": " is a Japanese manga artist. She is best known as the author of \"Sailor Moon\", one of the most popular manga series of all time.\nShe has won several awards, including the 1993 Kodansha Manga Award for \"Sailor Moon\".\nTakeuchi is married to Yoshihiro Togashi, the author of \"YuYu Hakusho\" and \"Hunter \u00d7 Hunter\".\nEarly life.\nTakeuchi was born in Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan, to parents Kenji and Ikuko Takeuchi. She has a younger brother, Shingo. She gave the names of her relatives to the characters she created for \"Sailor Moon\", and mentions this in interviews and in several comic strips she produced, in place of author notes.\nTakeuchi attended Kofu Ichi High School. She wore a seifuku and joined the astronomy and manga clubs. These experiences influenced her work for \"Sailor Moon\", in addition to her other pieces, such as \"Love Call\" and \"Rain Kiss\". Her formative high school experiences influenced her trajectory to become a manga artist. Takeuchi's father encouraged her to pursue other career paths, in case she wouldn't find success as a professional artist, which is why she attended university to study chemistry.\nTakeuchi graduated from the Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, where she received a degree in chemistry and became a licensed pharmacist. Her senior thesis was called \"Heightened Effects of Thrombolytic Actions Due to Ultrasound\".\nCareer.\n1986\u20131997: Early work and success.\nAfter graduating from the Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, at the age of 19, Takeuchi entered the manga industry by submitting her work \"Love Call\" to Kodansha; Takeuchi received Nakayoshi's New Artist award for \"Love Call\". She worked steadily on one-shot pieces until writing \"Maria\", which was published in \"Nakayoshi\" from early to mid-1990. This work, Takeuchi's first serial comic, was loosely based on Jean Webster's 1912 novel \"Daddy-Long-Legs\" and on her friend Marie Koizumi, who helped write it.\nAfter completing \"Maria\", Takeuchi worked on the ice-skating series \"The Cherry Project\", which was serialized in \"Nakayoshi\" from late 1990 to 1991. While working on \"The Cherry Project\", Takeuchi wanted to do a manga on outer space and girl fighters. Her editor, Fumio Osano, asked her to put the fighters in sailor suits. This concept would later become a one-shot called \"\", which would later begin serialization in \"RunRun\". When Toei Animation planned to adapt her manga into an anime series, she reworked \"Sailor V\" and added four other superheroines.\nIn December 1991, \"Nakayoshi\" began serializing \"Sailor Moon\", which became an instant hit. The success encouraged Takeuchi to work on both \"Sailor Moon\" and \"Sailor V\" from 1991 to 1997. However, \"RunRun\" was canceled with the November 1997 issue, and the planned \"Sailor V\" anime adaptation was canceled along with it. During that six-year period, she produced 60 chapters, which were collected in 18 volumes. The success of the manga led to a 200-episode anime adaptation, three animated films, numerous video games, and wide-ranging merchandising.\nAt the series' end, Takeuchi worked on \"PQ Angels\" for \"Nakayoshi\". This gained a fair amount of popularity, but was canceled due to Kodansha losing seven pages of her manuscript. Takeuchi said that Toei Animation had the manuscript, therefore it would have been possible to create an anime adaptation of the series.\nTakeuchi's own studio is called \"Princess Naoko Planning\" (PNP). Takeuchi established PNP to manage her properties, mainly \"Sailor Moon\". The studio later encompassed Yoshihiro Togashi's work as well and appeared in the credits for such anime as \"Level E\" and \"Hunter \u00d7 Hunter\". Its name also appears on the musical credits for \"Shin Kaguya Shima Densetsu\" and other projects.\n1998\u20132009.\nFollowing the loss of seven pages of Takeuchi's \"PQ Angels\" manuscript, Osano departed Kodansha and the plans for the \"Materials Collection\" were canceled. Takeuchi departed Kodansha for Shueisha.\nOn August 13, 1998, Takeuchi made her first appearance in the United States at the San Diego Comic-Con International convention for three days. That same year, she published the first \"Sailor Moon\" artbook since her departure from Kodansha, \"Sailor Moon Infinity Collection Art Book\" with limited releases.\nWhile working on her short comic strip \"Princess Naoko Takeuchi Back-to-Work Punch!!\", Takeuchi met Yoshihiro Togashi at a \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" meeting hosted by Kazushi Hagiwara, and had a meeting arranged between them by voice actress Megumi Ogata. She collaborated with Togashi as an assistant (doing screentone) and as a manager on volume 1 of \"Hunter \u00d7 Hunter\". However, the work and the demands proved more than she had expected, and as a result, Takeuchi left Shueisha.\nAround this time, Takeuchi conceived the idea for a one-shot called \"Toki\u2606Meka\", which eventually turned into \"Toki\u2606Meca\". Togashi had a similar idea at the same time as her, but never fully brought it to fruition. He helped somewhat with \"Toki\u2606Meka\" at this point in developing the idea by drawing some concept sketches, which Takeuchi showed in \"Toki\u2606Meca\" volume 1.\nTogashi and Takeuchi married in 1999. From this marriage, the couple have two children: a son, born in January 2001, and another child, born in 2009.\nAfter Kodansha's rights to \"Sailor Moon\" expired, Takeuchi returned to the publisher in 1999 to develop and publish the \"Materials Collection\". She also began serializing \"Love Witch\", but it was cancelled. Takeuchi started to work on the reprints of \"Sailor Moon\" and \"Sailor V\", and published \"Toki\u2606Meca\" in \"Nakayoshi\".\nIn 2003, Takeuchi became heavily involved in producing \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\", a tokusatsu television series based on \"Sailor Moon\", as she had an interest in learning more about the anime industry. This culminated in the creation of \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\". The series displays a plot that is heavily reliant on the manga and also explores many themes that the manga was unable to explore. She showed up at the official conference with a fist up, meaning \"good luck\", in Act Zero.\nAfter the production of \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\" ended in 2004, Takeuchi continued to work on \"Toki\u2606Meca\". During the manga's serialization, Osano returned as her editor. Takeuchi also worked more closely with managing PNP and gave talks to college students. At the same time, she wrote a children's book titled \"Oboo-nu- to Chiboo-nu-\" as a birthday present to her son. (Togashi provided illustrations for the book; Takeuchi made mention of this in the back of the first volume of \"Toki\u2606Meca\".) She still works on the website, updating it about once a month with new flash animations or profiles.\n2010\u20132019.\nIn 2012, it was announced that a new \"Sailor Moon\" anime adaptation was in development. With it, Takeuchi started a \"Kanzenban\" version of the manga, which was announced by Osano, and will include fixed past mistakes and new covers for the manga. Color pages are also included for the title pages. There was also an artbook announced, and she has been working on merchandise, which was announced by Osano on his Twitter feed.\nThe new reboot anime, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal\", debuted in July 2014. It streamed on Niconico bi-weekly, and ended in July 2015, spanning a total of 26 episodes, which cover the \"Dark Kingdom\" and \"Black Moon\" arc of the manga. Takeuchi wrote the ending theme song, , under her penname, . The series eventually gained its 13-episode third season, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal Season III\", covering the \"Infinity\" arc of the manga (known as \"Death Busters\" in Japan), and aired weekly on Japanese television from April to June 2016.\n2020\u2013present.\nIn 2020, the two volumes of official of the \"Sailor Moon\" manga was released on June 29, with Takeuchi providing new illustrations for both covers.\nIn 2021, Takeuchi chief supervised the production of the two-part anime film, \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie\", which adapted the \"Dream\" arc of the manga (known as \"Dead Moon\" in Japan), and acted as a \"fourth season\" for the \"Sailor Moon Crystal\" series. Both films were released in 2021 in Japanese theaters, with the first film on January 8, and the second film on February 11. Takeuchi also provided the lyrics for the theme song, , under the name of \"Sumire Shirobara\".\nIn 2022, it was announced that Takeuchi will chief supervise the production of the sequel to \"Sailor Moon Eternal\", titled \"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Cosmos The Movie\". The two-part film will cover the \"Stars\" arc of the manga (known as \"Shadow Galactica\" in Japan), and will act as \"fifth and final season\" for the \"Sailor Moon Crystal\" series. Both films will be released in Summer 2023.\nWorks.\nSong lyrics.\nTakeuchi wrote the lyrics for a number of songs featured in the \"Sailor Moon\" anime and live-action series. Though mainly character-based image songs, they include a few theme songs.\nThese include:\nAwards.\nTakeuchi has won several awards, including the 2nd Nakayoshi Comic Prize for Newcomers for \"Yume ja Nai no Ne\" in 1985. She also won for \"Love Call\", which won Nakayoshi's New Artist award which debuted in the Nakayoshi Deluxe September 1986 issue. In 1993 she won the 17th Kodansha Manga Award for sh\u014djo for \"Sailor Moon\"."}
{"id": "21746", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21746", "title": "Nolo contendere", "text": " is a legal term that comes from the Latin phrase for \"I do not wish to contend\". It is also referred to as a plea of no contest or no defense.\nIn criminal trials in certain United States jurisdictions, it is a plea where the defendant neither admits nor disputes a charge, serving as an alternative to a pleading of guilty or not guilty. A no-contest plea, while not technically a guilty plea, typically has the same immediate effect as a guilty plea and is often offered as a part of a plea bargain. In many jurisdictions, a plea of \" is not a typical right and carries various restrictions on its use.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, state law determines whether, and under what circumstances, a defendant may plead no contest in state criminal cases. In federal court, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure only allow a \" plea to be entered with the court's consent; before accepting the plea, the court is required to \"consider the parties' views and the public interest in the effective administration of justice\".\nResidual effects.\nA ' plea has the same immediate effects as a plea of guilty, but may have different residual effects or consequences in future actions. For instance, a conviction arising from a ' plea is subject to any and all penalties, fines, and forfeitures of a conviction from a guilty plea in the same case, and can be considered as an aggravating factor in future criminal actions. However, unlike a guilty plea, a defendant in a ' plea may not be required to allocute the charges. This means that a ' conviction typically may not be used to establish either negligence \"per se\", malice, or whether the acts were committed at all in later civil proceedings related to the same set of facts as the criminal prosecution.\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, and in those states whose rules of evidence are similar or identical to them, \"\" pleas may not be used to defeat the hearsay prohibition if offered as an \"admission by [a] party-opponent\". Assuming the appropriate gravity of the charge, and all other things being equal, a guilty plea to the same charge would cause the reverse effect: An opponent at trial could introduce the plea, over a hearsay objection, as evidence to establish a certain fact.\nAlaska.\nIn Alaska, a criminal conviction based on a \"\" plea may be used against the defendant in future civil actions. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that a \"conviction based on a no contest plea will collaterally estop the criminal defendant from denying any element in a subsequent civil action against him that was necessarily established by the conviction, as long as the prior conviction was for a serious criminal offense and the defendant in fact had the opportunity for a full and fair hearing\".\nCalifornia.\nIn California, a ' plea is known as a \"West plea\" after a seminal case involving plea bargains, \"People v. West\" (1970) 3 Cal.3d 595. The state Board of Pharmacy considers a plea of ' to be deemed a conviction with regard to issuing licenses for pharmacies, pharmacists and drug wholesalers.\nA \"nolo contendere\" plea to any felony is considered exactly equivalent to a guilty plea for the purposes of civil actions; this plea to any non-felony is not admissible to a civil action.\nFlorida.\nIn Florida, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that no-contest convictions may be treated as prior convictions for the purposes of future sentencing.\nMichigan.\nIn Michigan, \"A \"nolo contendere\" plea does not admit guilt, it merely communicates to the court that the criminal defendant does not wish to contest the state's accusations and will acquiesce in the imposition of punishment.\" A \"nolo contendere\" plea may be appropriate \"where the defendant would not be able to supply a sufficient factual basis for a guilty plea because he or she was intoxicated on the night of the incident, where there is the possibility of future civil litigation resulting from the offense, or where a defendant cannot remember the events which led to his or her being charged with a crime\".\nA no contest plea prevents the court from eliciting a defendant's admission of guilt, but the result of the defendant's plea not to contest the charges against him or her is the same as if the defendant had admitted guilt. If a defendant pleads no contest to a charged offense, with the exception of questioning the defendant about his or her role in the charged offense, the court must proceed in the same manner as if the defendant had pleaded guilty. A plea of no contest to a felony offense requires the court's consent.\nA defendant's no contest plea to criminal charges does not \"estop\" that defendant from denying responsibility in a later civil action arising from the same conduct.\nTexas.\nIn Texas, the right to appeal the results of a plea bargain taken from a plea of either ' or \"guilty\" is highly restricted. Defendants who have entered a plea of ' may only appeal the judgment of the court if the appeal is based on written pretrial motions ruled upon by the court.\nVirginia.\nThe Virginia Rules of Evidence differ from the parallel federal rules in that a \" plea entered in a criminal case is admissible in a related civil proceeding.\nCommonwealth.\nIn the Commonwealth countries \u2014 such as England and Wales, Scotland, Canada, and Australia \u2014 the plea of \" is not permitted. The defendant must enter a plea of \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\". If a defendant refuses to enter a plea, the court will record a plea of \"not guilty\"."}
{"id": "21748", "revid": "45020786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21748", "title": "Nationalism", "text": "Nationalism is an idea and movement that holds that the nation should be congruent with the state. As a movement, nationalism tends to promote the interests of a particular nation (as in a group of people), especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the nation's sovereignty (self-governance) over its homeland to create a nation-state. Nationalism holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-determination), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity, and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power. It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on a combination of shared social characteristics such as culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics (or the government), religion, traditions and belief in a shared singular history, and to promote national unity or solidarity. Nationalism, therefore, seeks to preserve and foster a nation's traditional culture. There are various definitions of a \"nation\", which leads to different types of nationalism. The two main divergent forms are ethnic nationalism and civic nationalism.\nNationalism developed at the end of the 18th century, particularly with the French Revolution and the spread of the principle of popular sovereignty (the idea that \"the people\" should rule). Three main theories have been used to explain its emergence. Primordialism (perennialism) developed alongside nationalism during the romantic era and held that there have always been nations. This view has since been rejected by scholars, and nations are now viewed as socially constructed and historically contingent. Modernization theory, currently the most commonly accepted theory of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible. Proponents of this theory describe nations as \"imagined communities\" and nationalism as an \"invented tradition\" in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity. A third theory, ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a product of symbols, myths, and traditions, as is associated with the work of Anthony D. Smith. Additionally, the spread of nationalist movements during decolonization has led many theorists to examine the role of elites in mobilizing communities in order to maintain their power.\nThe moral value of nationalism, the relationship between nationalism and patriotism, and the compatibility of nationalism and cosmopolitanism are all subjects of philosophical debate. Nationalism can be combined with diverse political goals and ideologies such as conservatism (national conservatism and right-wing populism) or socialism (left-wing nationalism). In practice, nationalism is seen as positive or negative depending on its ideology and outcomes. Nationalism has been a feature of movements for freedom and justice, has been associated with cultural revivals, and encourages pride in national achievements. It has also been used to legitimize racial, ethnic, and religious divisions, suppress or attack minorities, and undermine human rights and democratic traditions. Radical nationalism combined with racial hatred was a key factor in the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany.\nTerminology.\nThe terminological use of \"nations\", \"sovereignty\" and associated concepts were significantly refined with the writing by Hugo Grotius of \"De jure belli ac pacis\" in the early 17th century. Living in the times of the Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Netherlands and the Thirty Years' War between Catholic and Protestant European nations (Catholic France being in the otherwise Protestant camp), it is not surprising that Grotius was deeply concerned with matters of conflicts between nations in the context of oppositions stemming from religious differences. The word \"nation\" was also usefully applied before 1800 in Europe to refer to the inhabitants of a country as well as to collective identities that could include shared history, law, language, political rights, religion and traditions, in a sense more akin to the modern conception.\n\"Nationalism\" as derived from the noun designating 'nations' is a newer word; in the English language, the term dates back from 1798. The term first became important in the 19th century. The term increasingly became negative in its connotations after 1914. Glenda Sluga notes that \"The twentieth century, a time of profound disillusionment with nationalism, was also the great age of globalism.\"\nAcademics define nationalism as a political principle that holds that the nation and state should be congruent. According to Lisa Weeden, nationalist ideology presumes that \"the people\" and the state are congruent.\nHistory.\nScholars frequently place the beginning of nationalism in the late 18th century or early 19th century with the American Declaration of Independence or with the French Revolution. The consensus is that nationalism as a concept was firmly established by the 19th century. In histories of nationalism, the French Revolution (1789) is seen as an important starting point, not only for its impact on French nationalism but even more for its impact on Germans and Italians and on European intellectuals. The template of nationalism, as a method for mobilizing public opinion around a new state based on popular sovereignty, went back further than 1789: philosophers such as Rousseau and Voltaire, whose ideas influenced the French Revolution, had themselves been influenced or encouraged by the example of earlier constitutionalist liberation movements, notably the Corsican Republic (1755\u20131768) and American Revolution (1775\u20131783).\nDue to the Industrial Revolution, there was an emergence of an integrated, nation-encompassing economy and a national public sphere, where British people began to mobilize on a state-wide scale, rather than just in the smaller units of their province, town or family. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century and was actively promoted by the British government and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed by nationalists and widely adopted. The Union Jack was adopted in 1801 as the national one. Thomas Arne composed the patriotic song \"Rule, Britannia!\" in 1740, and the cartoonist John Arbuthnot invented the character of John Bull as the personification of the English national spirit in 1712.\nThe political convulsions of the late 18th century associated with the American and French revolutions massively augmented the widespread appeal of patriotic nationalism. Napoleon Bonaparte's rise to power further established nationalism when he invaded much of Europe. Napoleon used this opportunity to spread revolutionary ideas, resulting in much of the 19th-century European Nationalism.\nThe Prussian scholar Johann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803) originated the term in 1772 in his \"Treatise on the Origin of Language\" stressing the role of a common language. He attached exceptional importance to the concepts of nationality and of patriotism \"he that has lost his patriotic spirit has lost himself and the whole world about himself\", whilst teaching that \"in a certain sense every human perfection is national\".\nSome scholars argue that variants of nationalism emerged prior to the 18th century. American philosopher and historian Hans Kohn wrote in 1944 that nationalism emerged in the 17th century. In \"\" (Yale University Press, 1992), Linda Colley explores how the role of nationalism emerged about 1700 and developed in Britain reaching full form in the 1830s. Writing shortly after World War I, the popular British author H.G. Wells traced the origin of European nationalism to the aftermath of the Reformation, when it filled the moral void left by the decline of Christian faith:[A]s the idea of Christianity as a world brotherhood of men sank into discredit because of its fatal entanglement with priestcraft and the Papacy on the one hand and with the authority of princes on the other, and the age of faith passed into our present age of doubt and disbelief, men shifted the reference of their lives from the kingdom of God and the brotherhood of mankind to these apparently more living realities, France and England, Holy Russia, Spain, Prussia... **** In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the general population of Europe was religious and only vaguely patriotic; by the nineteenth it had become wholly patriotic.\n19th century.\nThe political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe. During the 19th century nationalism became one of the most significant political and social forces in history; it is typically listed among the top causes of World War I.\nNapoleon's conquests of the German and Italian states around 1800\u20131806 played a major role in stimulating nationalism and the demands for national unity.\nEnglish historian J. P. T. Bury argues:\nBetween 1830 and 1870 nationalism had thus made great strides. It inspired great literature, quickened scholarship, and nurtured heroes. It had shown its power both to unify and to divide. It had led to great achievements of political construction and consolidation in Germany and Italy; but it was more clear than ever a threat to the Ottoman and Habsburg empires, which were essentially multi-national. European culture had been enriched by the new vernacular contributions of little-known or forgotten peoples, but at the same time such unity as it had was imperiled by fragmentation. Moreover, the antagonisms fostered by nationalism had made not only for wars, insurrections, and local hatreds\u2014they had accentuated or created new spiritual divisions in a nominally Christian Europe.\nFrance.\nNationalism in France gained early expressions in France's revolutionary government. In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (\"lev\u00e9e en masse\") with a call to service:\nHenceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service. The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen to lint; the old men shall repair to the public places, to stimulate the courage of the warriors and preach the unity of the Republic and the hatred of kings.\nThis nationalism gained pace after the French Revolution came to a close. Defeat in war, with a loss in territory, was a powerful force in nationalism. In France, revenge and return of Alsace-Lorraine was a powerful motivating force for a quarter century after their defeat by Germany in 1871. After 1895, French nationalists focused on Dreyfus and internal subversion, and the Alsace issue petered out.\nThe French reaction was a famous case of \"Revanchism\" (\"revenge\") which demands the return of lost territory that \"belongs\" to the national homeland. Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.\nThe Dreyfus Affair in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists. Dreyfus, a Jew, was an outsider, that is in the views of intense nationalists, not a true Frenchman, not one to be trusted, not one to be given the benefit of the doubt. True loyalty to the nation, from the conservative viewpoint, was threatened by liberal and republican principles of liberty and equality that were leading the country to disaster.\nRussia.\nBefore 1815, the sense of Russian nationalism was weak\u2014what sense there was focused on loyalty and obedience to the tsar. The Russian motto \"Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality\" was coined by Count Sergey Uvarov and it was adopted by Emperor Nicholas I as the official ideology of the Russian Empire. Three components of Uvarov's triad were:\nBy the 1860s, as a result of educational indoctrination, and due to conservative resistance to ideas and ideologies which were transmitted from Western Europe, a pan-Slavic movement had emerged and it produced both a sense of Russian nationalism and a nationalistic mission to support and protect pan-Slavism. This Slavophile movement became popular in 19th-century Russia. Pan-Slavism was fueled by, and it was also the fuel for Russia's numerous wars against the Ottoman Empire which were waged in order to achieve the alleged goal of liberating Orthodox nationalities, such as Bulgarians, Romanians, Serbs and Greeks, from Ottoman rule. Slavophiles opposed the Western European influences which had been transmitted to Russia and they were also determined to protect Russian culture and traditions. Aleksey Khomyakov, Ivan Kireyevsky, and Konstantin Aksakov are credited with co-founding the movement.\nLatin America.\nAn upsurge in nationalism in Latin America in the 1810s and 1820s sparked revolutions that cost Spain nearly all of its colonies which were located there. Spain was at war with Britain from 1798 to 1808, and the British Royal Navy cut off its contacts with its colonies, so nationalism flourished and trade with Spain was suspended. The colonies set up temporary governments or juntas which were effectively independent from Spain. These juntas were established as a result of Napoleon's resistance failure in Spain. They served to determine new leadership and, in colonies like Caracas, abolished the slave trade as well as the Indian tribute. The division exploded between Spaniards who were born in Spain (called \"peninsulares\") versus those of Spanish descent born in New Spain (called \"criollos\" in Spanish or \"creoles\" in English). The two groups wrestled for power, with the criollos leading the call for independence. Spain tried to use its armies to fight back but had no help from European powers. Indeed, Britain and the United States worked against Spain, enforcing the Monroe Doctrine. Spain lost all of its American colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, in a complex series of revolts from 1808 to 1826.\nGermany.\nIn the German states west of Prussia, Napoleon abolished many of the old or medieval relics, such as dissolving the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. He imposed rational legal systems and demonstrated how dramatic changes were possible. His organization of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 promoted a feeling of nationalism.\nNationalists sought to encompass masculinity in their quest for strength and unity. It was Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck who achieved German unification through a series of highly successful short wars against Denmark, Austria and France which thrilled the pan-German nationalists in the smaller German states. They fought in his wars and eagerly joined the new German Empire, which Bismarck ran as a force for balance and peace in Europe after 1871.\nIn the 19th century, German nationalism was promoted by Hegelian-oriented academic historians who saw Prussia as the true carrier of the German spirit, and the power of the state as the ultimate goal of nationalism. The three main historians were Johann Gustav Droysen (1808\u20131884), Heinrich von Sybel (1817\u20131895) and Heinrich von Treitschke (1834\u20131896). Droysen moved from liberalism to an intense nationalism that celebrated Prussian Protestantism, efficiency, progress, and reform, in striking contrast to Austrian Catholicism, impotency and backwardness. He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia. His large-scale \"History of Prussian Politics\" (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars. Von Sybel founded and edited the leading academic history journal, \"Historische Zeitschrift\" and as the director of the Prussian state archives published massive compilations that were devoured by scholars of nationalism.\nThe most influential of the German nationalist historians, was Treitschke who had an enormous influence on elite students at Heidelberg and Berlin universities. Treitschke vehemently attacked parliamentarianism, socialism, pacifism, the English, the French, the Jews, and the internationalists. The core of his message was the need for a strong, unified state\u2014a unified Germany under Prussian supervision. \"It is the highest duty of the State to increase its power,\" he stated. Although he was a descendant of a Czech family, he considered himself not Slavic but German: \"I am 1000 times more the patriot than a professor.\"\nGerman nationalism, expressed through the ideology of National Socialism, however, may also be understood as trans-national in nature. This aspect was primarily advocated by Adolf Hitler, who later became the leader of the National Socialist Party. This party was devoted to what they identified as an Aryan race, residing in various European countries, but sometime mixed with alien elements such as Jews.\nMeanwhile, the Nazis rejected many of the well-established citizens within those same countries, such as the Romani (Gypsies) and of course Jews, whom they did not identify as Aryan. A key Nazi doctrine was \"Living Space\" (for Aryans only) or \"Lebensraum,\" which was a vast undertaking to transplant Aryans throughout Poland, much of Eastern Europe and the Baltic nations, and all of Western Russia and Ukraine. Lebensraum was thus a vast project for advancing the Aryan race far outside of any particular nation or national borders. The Nazi's goals were racist focused on advancing the Aryan race as they perceived it, eugenics modification of the human race, and the eradication of human beings that they deemed inferior. But their goals were trans-national and intended to spread across as much of the world as they could achieve. Although Nazism glorified German history, it also embraced the supposed virtues and achievements of the Aryan race in other countries, including India. The Nazis' Aryanism longed for now-extinct species of superior bulls once used as livestock by Aryans and other features of Aryan history that never resided within the borders of Germany as a nation.\nItaly.\nItalian nationalism emerged in the 19th century and was the driving force for Italian unification or the \"Risorgimento\" (meaning the \"Resurgence\" or \"Revival\"). It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. The memory of the \"Risorgimento\" is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal middle classes and ultimately proved a bit weak. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a kind of underdeveloped province for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as Italo-Dalmatian dialects of Neapolitan and Sicilian were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the pope and the very well organized Catholic Church. The liberal government under the Sicilian Francesco Crispi sought to enlarge his political base by emulating Otto von Bismarck and firing up Italian nationalism with an aggressive foreign policy. It partially crashed and his cause was set back. Of his nationalistic foreign policy, historian R. J. B. Bosworth says:\n[Crispi] pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with these suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies. His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at Adowa [...] in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army. Crispi, whose private life and personal finances [...] were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.\nItaly joined the Allies in the First World War after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was not honored after the war and this fact discredited liberalism paving the way for Benito Mussolini and a political doctrine of his own creation, Fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars with the creation of the Italian Empire, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War. After 1945, the Catholics returned to government and tensions eased somewhat, but the former two Sicilies remained poor and partially underdeveloped (by industrial country standards). However, in the fifties and early sixties Italy enjoyed an economic boom, that pushed its economy to the fifth place between the world nations.\nThe working class in those decades voted mostly for the Communist Party, and it looked to Moscow rather than Rome for inspiration and was kept out of the national government even as it controlled some industrial cities across the North. In the 21st century, the Communists have become marginal but political tensions remained high as shown by Umberto Bossi's Padanism in the 1980s (whose party Lega Nord has come to partially embrace a moderate version of Italian nationalism over the years) and other separatist movements spread across the country.\nGreece.\nDuring the early 19th century, inspired by romanticism, classicism, former movements of Greek nationalism and failed Greek revolts against the Ottoman Empire (such as the Orlofika revolt in southern Greece in 1770, and the Epirus-Macedonian revolt of Northern Greece in 1575), Greek nationalism led to the Greek war of independence. The Greek drive for independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 1820s and 1830s inspired supporters across Christian Europe, especially in Britain, which was the result of western idealization of Classical Greece and romanticism. France, Russia and Britain critically intervened to ensure the success of this nationalist endeavor.\nSerbia.\nFor centuries the Orthodox Christian Serbs were ruled by the Muslim Ottoman Empire. The success of the Serbian Revolution against Ottoman rule in 1817 marked the birth of the Principality of Serbia. It achieved \"de facto\" independence in 1867 and finally gained international recognition in 1878. Serbia had sought to liberate and unite with Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west and Old Serbia (Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia) to the south. Nationalist circles in both Serbia and Croatia (part of Austria-Hungary) began to advocate for a greater South Slavic union in the 1860s, claiming Bosnia as their common land based on shared language and tradition. In 1914, Serb revolutionaries in Bosnia assassinated Archduke Ferdinand. Austria-Hungary, with German backing, tried to crush Serbia in 1914, thus igniting the First World War in which Austria-Hungary dissolved into nation states.\nIn 1918, the region of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja came under control of the Serbian army, later the Great National Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs voted to join Serbia; the Kingdom of Serbia joined the union with State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on 1 December 1918, and the country was named Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It was renamed Yugoslavia, and a Yugoslav identity was promoted, which ultimately failed. After the Second World War, Yugoslav Communists established a new socialist republic of Yugoslavia. That state broke up again in the 1990s.\nPoland.\nThe cause of Polish nationalism was repeatedly frustrated before 1918. In the 1790s, the Habsburg monarchy, Prussia and Russia\ninvaded, annexed, and subsequently partitioned Poland. Napoleon set up the Duchy of Warsaw, a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as Congress Poland with the tsar proclaimed as \"King of Poland\". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted in 1830 and 1863\u201364 but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the Polish language, culture and religion more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939. Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the Kulturkampf of the 1870s. The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new Centre Party, and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the Piast Concept. It held there was a Polish utopia during the Piast Dynasty a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the \"Piast Concept\" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the National Democracy Party, known as the \"Endecja,\" which was led by Roman Dmowski. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.\nThe Piast concept stood in opposition to the \"Jagiellon Concept,\" which allowed for multi-ethnicism and Polish rule over numerous minority groups such as those in the Kresy. The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. Soviet dictator Josef Stalin at Tehran in 1943 rejected the Jagiellon Concept because it involved Polish rule over Ukrainians and Belarusians. He instead endorsed the Piast Concept, which justified a massive shift of Poland's frontiers to the west. After 1945 the Soviet-back puppet communist regime wholeheartedly adopted the Piast Concept, making it the centerpiece of their claim to be the \"true inheritors of Polish nationalism\". After all the killings, including Nazi German occupation, terror in Poland and population transfers during and after the war, the nation was officially declared as 99% ethnically Polish.\nIn current Polish politics, Polish nationalism is most openly represented by parties linked in the Liberty and Independence Confederation coalition. As of 2020 the Confederation, composed of several smaller parties, had 11 deputies (under 7%) in the Sejm.\nBulgarian nationalism.\nBulgarian modern nationalism emerged under Ottoman rule in the late 18th and early 19th century, under the influence of western ideas such as liberalism and nationalism, which trickled into the country after the French Revolution.\nThe Bulgarian national revival started with the work of Saint Paisius of Hilendar, who opposed Greek domination of Bulgaria's culture and religion. His work \"Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya\" (\"History of the Slav-Bulgarians\"), which appeared in 1762, was the first work of Bulgarian historiography. It is considered Paisius' greatest work and one of the greatest pieces of Bulgarian literature. In it, Paisius interpreted Bulgarian medieval history with the goal of reviving the spirit of his nation.\nHis successor was Saint Sophronius of Vratsa, who started the struggle for an independent Bulgarian church. An autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate was established in 1870/1872 for the Bulgarian diocese wherein at least two-thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it.\nIn 1869 the Internal Revolutionary Organization was initiated.\nThe April Uprising of 1876 indirectly resulted in the re-establishment of Bulgaria in 1878.\nJewish nationalism.\nJewish nationalism arose in the latter half of the 19th century and its rise was largely correlated with the rise of the Zionist movement. The term \"Zionism\" was derived from the word \"Zion\", which was one of the Torah's names of the city of Jerusalem. The end goal of Jewish nationalists and Zionists was the founding of a Jewish state, preferably in the land of Israel. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming that Israel was a homeland. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\nIt was the French Revolution of 1789 which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. According to historian David Engel, Zionism was more about fear that Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies of historical texts.\n20th century.\nChina.\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent. The key episode was the decisive defeat of Russia by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat which quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey, and Persia. In China Sun Yat-sen (1866\u20131925) launched his new party the Kuomintang (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. The Kuomintang recruits pledged:\n[F]rom this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.\nThe Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun's nationalism as well as by the May Fourth Movement in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism. The New Culture Movement stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Historian Patricia Ebrey says:\nNationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; imperialism, feudalism, warlordism, autocracy, patriarchy, and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.\nGreece.\nNationalist irredentist movements Greek advocating for Enosis (unity of ethnically Greek states with the Hellenic Republic to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of Cyprus, as well as the Megali Idea, the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as Crete, Ionia, Pontus, Northern Epirus, Cappadocia, Thrace among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the Greco-Turkish war of 1919.\nThe 4th of August regime was a fascist or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by Mussolini's Fascist Italy and Hitler's Germany and led by Greek general Ioannis Metaxas from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were Ancient Greece and the Byzantine empire respectively. It promoted Greek traditions, folk music and dances, classicism as well as medievalism.\nAfrica.\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and the 1960s, colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria, Kenya and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa, nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives had learned in the British and French, and other armies during the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers or the traditional local power structures that had been collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.\nSouth Africa, a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948, it was controlled by white Afrikaner nationalists, who focused on racial segregation and white minority rule, known as apartheid. It lasted until 1994, when multiracial elections were held. The international anti-apartheid movement supported black nationalists until success was achieved, and Nelson Mandela was elected president.\nMiddle East.\nArab nationalism, a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the late 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the Ottoman Empire declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs, rather than foreigners. Syria was established in 1920; Transjordan (later Jordan) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; Saudi Arabia was established in 1932; and Egypt achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The Arab League was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\nParallel to those efforts was the Zionist movement, which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. In 1882, Jews, predominantly from Europe, began to emigrate to Ottoman Palestine with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the State of Israel in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations launched an invasion to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\nBreakup of Yugoslavia.\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the Revolutions of 1989 had triggered the collapse of communism in the 1990s. That left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, but they now found themselves free to choose. That made long-dormant conflicts rise and create sources of serious conflict. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to a rise in extreme nationalism.\nIn his 1992 article \"Jihad vs. McWorld,\" Benjamin Barber proposed that the fall of communism would cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small-scale wars would become common, as groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies. The fall of communism also allowed for an \"us vs. them\" mentality to return. Governments would become vehicles for social interests, and the country would attempt to form national policies based on the majority culture, religion or ethnicity. Some newly-sprouted democracies had large differences in policies on matters, which ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\nThe academic Steven Berg felt that the root of nationalist conflicts was the demand for autonomy and a separate existence. That nationalism can give rise to strong emotions, which may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries. Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily, as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs and caused death and destruction. When that happens, states unable to contain the conflict run the risk of slowing their progress at democratization.\nYugoslavia was established after the First World War and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups: Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The national census numbers from 1971 to 1981 measured an increase from 1.3% to 5.4% in the population that ethnically identified itself as Yugoslavs. That meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic and national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\nIn Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia, in the northwest, were conquered by Catholics or Protestants and benefited from European history: the Renaissance, the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. That made them more inclined towards democracy. The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Russian Empires, are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\nIn the 1970s, the leadership of the separate territories in Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests, at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so that any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross adjacent territories: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia had no group with a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslavs stopped leadership from advancing here either. Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalisms. Within the territories, leaderships would not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another and raise the possibility of a serious conflict. That strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities and caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\nIn the 1980s, Yugoslavia began to break into fragments. Economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and ethnic hostilities. The per capita income of people in the northwestern territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, was several times higher than that of the southern territory. That, combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, intensified economic conditions. The violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and the rest of Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by a communist Serb, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, to increase Serb nationalism further. As mentioned, that nationalism gave rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism by highly-nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high that Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 ousted leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories. Slovenia, one of the four regions not under communist control, favoured a democratic state.\nIn Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milo\u0161evi\u0107 would use the militia to suppress the country, as had occurred in Kosovo. Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989, tensions came to a head, and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution that had been conceived by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to strengthen unity and later became the backdrop for the fall of communism in Yugoslavia.\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities. Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-communist borders, which threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and were compounded by actions from his regime.\nAlso, within the territory, the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serbian and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and to decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition, but that would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already practically independent from Kosovo, but Serbia did not want to let Kosovo become independent. Albanian nationalists wanted their own territory, but that would require a redrawing of the map and threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions, which evoked, in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what one believed, a fight for the survival of the group. The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. For six years, 200,000\u2013500,000 people died in the Bosnian War. All three major ethnicities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian Muslims, Croats, Serbs) suffered at the hands of each other. The war garnered assistance from groups, Muslim, Orthodox, and Western Christian, and from state actors, which supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia; Russia supported Serbia; Central European and the West, including the US, supported Croatia; and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n21st century.\nArab nationalism began to decline in the 21st century, which led to localized nationalism and culminated in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the Arab Spring. Following those revolts, most of which failing to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab and even most local nationalist movements declined dramatically. A consequence of the Arab Spring as well as the 2003 invasion of Iraq were the civil wars in Iraq and Syria, which eventually joined to form a single conflict. However, a new form of Arab nationalism has developed in the wake of the Arab Winter, embodied by Egyptian President Abdel Fatteh el-Sisi, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and UAE leader Mohammed bin Zayed.\nThe rise of globalism in the late 20th century led to a rise in nationalism and populism in Europe and North America. That trend was further fueled by increased terrorism in the West (the September 11 attacks in the United States being a prime example), increasing unrest and civil wars in the Middle East, and waves of Muslim refugees, especially from the Syrian Civil War, flooding into Europe ( the refugee crisis appears to have peaked). Nationalist groups like Germany's Pegida, France's National Front and the UK Independence Party gained prominence in their respective nations advocating restrictions on immigration to protect the local populations.\nSince 2010, Catalan nationalists have led a renewed Catalan independence movement and declared Catalan independence. The movement has been opposed by Spanish nationalists. In the 2010s, the Greek economic crisis and waves of immigration have led to a significant rise of Fascism and Greek nationalism across Greece, especially among the youth.\nIn Russia, exploitation of nationalist sentiments allowed Vladimir Putin to consolidate power. This nationalist sentiment was used in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and other actions in Ukraine. Nationalist movements gradually began to rise in Central Europe as well, particularly Poland, under the influence of the ruling party, Law and Justice (led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski). In Hungary, the anti-immigration rhetoric and stance against foreign influence is a powerful national glue promoted the ruling Fidesz party (led by Viktor Orb\u00e1n). Nationalist parties have also joined governing coalitions in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia and Ukraine.\nIn India, Hindu nationalism has grown in popularity with the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a right-wing party which has been ruling India at the national level since 2014. The rise in religious nationalism comes with the rise of right-wing populism in India, with the election and re-election of populist leader Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, who promised economic prosperity for all and an end to corruption. Militant Buddhist nationalism is also on the rise in Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka.\nIn Japan, nationalist influences in the government developed over the course of the early 21th century, largely from the far right ultra-conservative Nippon Kaigi organization. The new movement has advocated re-establishing Japan as a military power and pushed revisionist historical narratives denying events such as the Nanking Massacre.\nA referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom was held on 18 September 2014. The proposal was defeated, with 55.3% voting against independence. In a 2016 referendum, the British populace voted to withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Union (known as \"Brexit\"). The result had been largely unexpected and was seen as a victory of populism. As the promise of continued European Union membership was a core feature of the anti-independence campaign during the Scottish referendum, there have been calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence.\nThe 2016 United States presidential campaign saw the unprecedented rise of Donald Trump, a businessman with no political experience who ran on a populist/nationalist platform and struggled to gain endorsements from mainstream political figures, even within his own party. Trump's slogans \"\"Make America Great Again\" and \"America First\"\" exemplified his campaign's repudiation of globalism and its staunchly nationalistic outlook. His unexpected victory in the election was seen as part of the same trend that had brought about the Brexit vote. On 22 October 2018, two weeks before the mid-term elections President Trump openly proclaimed that he was a nationalist to a cheering crowd at a rally in Texas in support of re-electing Senator Ted Cruz who was once an adversary. On 29 October 2018 Trump equated nationalism to patriotism, saying \"I'm proud of this country and I call that \"nationalism.\"\nIn 2016, Rodrigo Duterte became president of the Philippines running a distinctly nationalist campaign. Contrary to the policies of his recent predecessors, he distanced the country from the Philippines' former ruler, the United States, and sought closer ties with China (as well as Russia).\nIn 2017, Turkish nationalism propelled President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan to gain unprecedented power in a national referendum. Reactions from world leaders were mixed, with Western European leaders generally expressing concern while the leaders of many of the more authoritarian regimes as well as President Trump offered their congratulations.\nPolitical science.\nMany political scientists have theorized about the foundations of the modern nation-state and the concept of sovereignty. The concept of nationalism in political science draws from these theoretical foundations. Philosophers like Machiavelli, Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau conceptualized the state as the result of a \"social contract\" between rulers and individuals. Max Weber provides the most commonly used definition of the state, \"that human community which successfully lays claim to the monopoly of legitimate physical violence within a certain territory\". According to Benedict Anderson, nations are \"Imagined Communities\", or socially constructed institutions.\nMany scholars have noted the relationship between state-building, war, and nationalism. Many scholars believe that the development of nationalism in Europe and subsequently the modern nation-state was due to the threat of war. \"External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat\". With increased external threats, the state's extractive capacities increase. Jeffrey Herbst argues that the lack of external threats to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, post-independence, is linked to weak state nationalism and state capacity. Barry Posen argues that nationalism increases the intensity of war, and that states deliberately promote nationalism with the aim of improving their military capabilities. Most new nation-states since 1815 have emerged through decolonization.\nAdria Lawrence has argued that nationalism in the colonial world was spurred by failures of colonial powers to extend equal political rights to the subjects in the colonies, thus prompting them to pursue independence. Michael Hechter has argued similarly that \"peripheral nationalisms\" formed when empires prevented peripheral regions from having autonomy and local rule.\nSociology.\nThe sociological or modernist interpretation of nationalism and nation-building argues that nationalism arises and flourishes in modern societies that have an industrial economy capable of self-sustainability, a central supreme authority capable of maintaining authority and unity, and a centralized language understood by a community of people. Modernist theorists note that this is only possible in modern societies, while traditional societies typically lack the prerequisites for nationalism. They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.\nProminent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: Carlton J. H. Hayes, Henry Maine, Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, Rabindranath Tagore, \u00c9mile Durkheim, Max Weber, Arnold Joseph Toynbee and Talcott Parsons.\nIn his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies, Henry Maine noted that the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.\nIn his book \"Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft\" (1887), Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies defined a \"Gemeinschaft\" (\"community\") as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies while defining a \"Gesellschaft\" (\"society\") as an impersonal society that is modern. Although he recognized the advantages of modern societies, he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused alienation while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\". Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of anomie.\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.\nPrimordialist evolutionary interpretation.\nThe primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory. This approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts. Laland and Brown report that \"the vast majority of professional academics in the social sciences not only ... ignore evolutionary methods but in many cases [are] extremely hostile to the arguments\" that draw vast generalizations from rather limited evidence.\nThe evolutionary theory of nationalism perceives nationalism to be the result of the evolution of human beings into identifying with groups, such as ethnic groups, or other groups that form the foundation of a nation. Roger Masters in \"The Nature of Politics\" describes the primordial explanation of the origin of ethnic and national groups as recognizing group attachments that are thought to be unique, emotional, intense, and durable because they are based upon kinship and promoted along lines of common ancestry.\nThe primordia list evolutionary views of nationalism often reference the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin as well as Social Darwinist views of the late nineteenth century. Thinkers like Herbert Spencer and Walter Bagehot reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations. Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like John Tooby and Leda Cosmides.\nApproached through the primordia list perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response. There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions. As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n[T]he articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.\nIn 1920, English historian G. P. Gooch argued that \"[while patriotism is as old as human association and has gradually widened its sphere from the clan and the tribe to the city and the state, nationalism as an operative principle and an articulate creed only made its appearance among the more complicated intellectual processes of the modern world.\"\nMarxist interpretations.\nIn \"The Communist Manifesto\", Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels declared that \"the working men have no country\". Vladimir Lenin supported the concept of self-determination. Joseph Stalin's \"Marxism and the National Question\" (1913) declares that \"a nation is not a racial or tribal, but a historically constituted community of people;\" \"a nation is not a casual or ephemeral conglomeration, but a stable community of people\"; \"a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic intercourse, as a result of people living together generation after generation\"; and, in its entirety: \"a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.\"\nTypes.\nHistorians, sociologists and anthropologists have debated different types of nationalism since at least the 1930s. Generally, the most common way of classifying nationalism has been to describe movements as having either \"civic\" or \"ethnic\" nationalist characteristics. This distinction was popularized in the 1950s by Hans Kohn who described \"civic\" nationalism as \"Western\" and more democratic while depicting \"ethnic\" nationalism as \"Eastern\" and undemocratic. Since the 1980s, however, scholars of nationalism have pointed out numerous flaws in this rigid division and proposed more specific classifications and numerous varieties.\nAnti-colonial nationalism.\nAnti-colonial nationalism is an intellectual framework that preceded, accompanied and followed the process of decolonization in the mid-1900s. Benedict Anderson defined a nation as a socially constructed community that is co-created by individuals who imagine themselves as part of this group. He points to the New World as the site that originally conceived of nationalism as a concept, which is defined by its imagination of an ahistorical identity that negates colonialism by definition. This concept of nationalism was exemplified by the transformation of settler colonies into nations, while anti-colonial nationalism is exemplified by movements against colonial powers in the 1900s.\nNationalist mobilization in French colonial Africa and British colonial India developed \"when colonial regimes refused to cede rights to their increasingly well-educated colonial subjects\", who formed indigenous elites and strategically adopted and adapted nationalist tactics. New national identities may cross pre-existing ethnic or linguistic divisions. Anti-colonial independence movements in Africa and Asia in the 1900s were led by individuals who had a set of shared identities and imagined a homeland without external rule. Anderson argues that the racism often experienced as a result of colonial rule and attributed to nationalism is rather due to theories of class.\nGellner\u2019s theory of nationalism argues that nationalism works for combining one culture or ethnicity in one state, which leads to that state\u2019s success. For Gellner, nationalism is ethnic, and state political parties should reflect the ethnic majority in the state. This definition of nationalism also contributes to anti-colonial nationalism, if one conceives of anti-colonial movements to be movements consisting of one specific ethnic group against an outside ruling party. Edward Said also saw nationalism as ethnic, at least in part, and argued that nationalist narratives often go hand in hand with racism, as communities define themselves in relation to the other.\nAnti-colonial nationalism is not static and is defined by different forms of nationalism depending on location. In the anti-colonial movement that took place in the Indian subcontinent, Mahatma Gandhi and his allies in the Indian independence movement argued for a composite nationalism, not believing that an independent Indian nation should be defined by its religious identity. Despite large-scale opposition, the Indian subcontinent was partitioned into two states in 1947: the Muslim-majority Pakistan and the Hindu-majority Dominion of India.\nBecause of colonialism\u2019s creation of state and country lines across ethnic, religious, linguistic and other historical boundaries, anti-colonial nationalism is largely related to land first. After independence, especially in countries with particularly diverse populations with historic enmity, there have been a series of smaller independence movements that are also defined by anti-colonialism.\nPhilosopher and scholar Achille Mbembe argues that post-colonialism is a contradictory term, because colonialism is ever present. Those that participate in this intellectual practice envision a post-colonialism despite its being the defining frame for the world. This is the case with anti-colonialism as well. Anti-colonial nationalism as an intellectual framework persisted into the late 20th century with the resistance movements in Soviet satellite states and continues with independence movements in the Arab world in the 21st century.\nCivic nationalism and liberal nationalism.\nCivic nationalism defines the nation as an association of people who identify themselves as belonging to the nation, who have equal and shared political rights, and allegiance to similar political procedures. According to the principles of civic nationalism, the nation is not based on common ethnic ancestry, but is a political entity whose core identity is not ethnicity. This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by Ernest Renan in his lecture in 1882 \"What is a Nation?\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily plebiscite\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with liberal nationalism, although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French Legitimism or Spanish Carlism often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the Corsican Republic, United Irishmen, Breton Federalist League or Catalan Republican Party could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-xenophobic nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with liberal values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights. Ernest Renan and John Stuart Mill are often thought to be early liberal nationalists. Liberal nationalists often defend the value of national identity by saying that individuals need a national identity to lead meaningful, autonomous lives, and that liberal democratic polities need national identity to function properly.\nCivic nationalism lies within the traditions of rationalism and liberalism, but as a form of nationalism it is usually contrasted with ethnic nationalism. Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individual's resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose (Ernest Renan's classic description in What is a Nation? (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavor). Renan argued that factors such as ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling dynasty and historic military deeds were important but not sufficient. Needed was a spiritual soul that allowed as a \"daily referendum\" among the people. Civic-national ideals influenced the development of representative democracy in multiethnic countries such as the United States and France, as well as in constitutional monarchies such as Great Britain, Belgium and Spain.\nGerman philosopher Monika Kirloskar-Steinbach does not think liberalism and nationalism are compatible, but she points out there are many liberals who think they are. Kirloskar-Steinbach states:\nJustifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.\nCreole nationalism.\nCreole nationalism is the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century. It was facilitated when French Emperor Napoleon seized control of Spain and Portugal, breaking the chain of control from the Spanish and Portuguese kings to the local governors. Allegiance to the Napoleonic states was rejected, and increasingly the creoles demanded independence. They achieved it after civil wars 1808\u20131826.\nEthnic nationalism.\nEthnic nationalism, also known as ethno-nationalism, is a form of nationalism wherein the \"nation\" is defined in terms of ethnicity. The central theme of ethnic nationalists is that \"nations are defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a common language, a common faith, and a common ethnic ancestry\". It also includes ideas of a culture shared between members of the group, and with their ancestors. However, it is different from a purely cultural definition of \"the nation,\" which allows people to become members of a nation by cultural assimilation; and from a purely linguistic definition, according to which \"the nation\" consists of all speakers of a specific language.\nWhereas nationalism in and of itself does not imply a belief in the superiority of one ethnicity or country over others, some nationalists support ethnocentric supremacy or protectionism.\nThe humiliation of being a second-class citizen led regional minorities in multiethnic states, such as Great Britain, Spain, France, Germany, Russia and the Ottoman Empire, to define nationalism in terms of loyalty to their minority culture, especially language and religion. Forced assimilation was anathema.\nFor the politically dominant cultural group, assimilation was necessary to minimize disloyalty and treason and therefore became a major component of nationalism. A second factor for the politically dominant group was competition with neighboring states\u2014nationalism involved a rivalry, especially in terms of military prowess and economic strength.\nEconomic nationalism.\nEconomic nationalism, or economic patriotism, is an ideology that favors state interventionism in the economy, with policies that emphasize domestic control of the economy, labor, and capital formation, even if this requires the imposition of tariffs and other restrictions on the movement of labor, goods and capital.\nGendered and muscular nationalism.\nFeminist critique interprets nationalism as a mechanism through which sexual control and repression are justified and legitimized, often by a dominant masculine power. The gendering of nationalism through socially constructed notions of masculinity and femininity not only shapes what masculine and feminine participation in the building of that nation will look like, but also how the nation will be imagined by nationalists. A nation having its own identity is viewed as necessary, and often inevitable, and these identities are gendered. The physical land itself is often gendered as female (i.e. \"Motherland\"), with a body in constant danger of violation by foreign males, while national pride and protectiveness of \"her\" borders is gendered as masculine.\nHistory, political ideologies, and religions place most nations along a continuum of muscular nationalism. Muscular nationalism conceptualizes a nation's identity as being derived from muscular or masculine attributes that are unique to a particular country. If definitions of nationalism and gender are understood as socially and culturally constructed, the two may be constructed in conjunction by invoking an \"us\" versus \"them\" dichotomy for the purpose of the exclusion of the so-called \"other,\" who is used to reinforce the unifying ties of the nation. The empowerment of one gender, nation or sexuality tends to occur at the expense and disempowerment of another; in this way, nationalism can be used as an instrument to perpetuate heteronormative structures of power. The gendered manner in which dominant nationalism has been imagined in most states in the world has had important implications on not only individual's lived experience, but on international relations. Colonialism has historically been heavily intertwined with muscular nationalism, from research linking hegemonic masculinity and empire-building, to intersectional oppression being justified by colonialist images of the \u201cother\u201d, a practice integral in the formation of Western identity. This \u201cothering\u201d may come in the form of orientalism, whereby the East is feminized and sexualized by the West. The imagined feminine East, or \u201cother,\u201d exists in contrast to the masculine West.\nThe status of conquered nations can become a causality dilemma: the nation was \u201cconquered because they were effeminate and seen as effeminate because they were conquered.\u201d In defeat they are considered militaristically unskilled, not aggressive, and thus not muscular. In order for a nation to be considered \u201cproper\u201d, it must possess the male-gendered characteristics of virility, as opposed to the stereotypically female characteristics of subservience and dependency. Muscular nationalism is often inseparable from the concept of a warrior, which shares ideological commonalities across many nations; they are defined by the masculine notions of aggression, willingness to engage in war, decisiveness, and muscular strength, as opposed to the feminine notions of peacefulness, weakness, non-violence, and compassion. This masculinized image of a warrior has been theorized to be \u201cthe culmination of a series of gendered historical and social processes\" played out in a national and international context. Ideas of cultural dualism\u2014of a martial man and chaste woman\u2014which are implicit in muscular nationalism, underline the raced, classed, gendered, and heteronormative nature of dominant national identity.\nNations and gender systems are mutually supportive constructions: the nation fulfils the masculine ideals of comradeship and brotherhood. Masculinity has been cited as a notable factor in producing political militancy. A common feature of national crisis is a drastic shift in the socially acceptable ways of being a man, which then helps to shape the gendered perception of the nation as a whole.\nIntegral nationalism, irredentism and pan-nationalism.\nThere are different types of nationalism including Risorgimento nationalism and Integral nationalism. Whereas risorgimento nationalism applies to a nation seeking to establish a liberal state (for example the Risorgimento in Italy and similar movements in Greece, Germany, Poland during the 19th century or the civic American nationalism), integral nationalism results after a nation has achieved independence and has established a state. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are anti-individualism, statism, radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. Pan-Slavism is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all Slavic people into one country. They did succeed by uniting several south Slavic people into Yugoslavia in 1918.\nLeft-wing nationalism.\nLeft-wing nationalism, occasionally known as socialist nationalism, not to be confused with the German fascist National Socialism, is a political movement that combines left-wing politics with nationalism.\nMany nationalist movements are dedicated to national liberation, in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise self-determination by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors. Anti-revisionist Marxism\u2013Leninism is closely tied with this ideology, and practical examples include Stalin's early work \"Marxism and the National Question\" and his socialism in one country edict, which declares that nationalism can be used in an internationalist context, fighting for national liberation without racial or religious divisions.\nOther examples of left-wing nationalism include Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement that launched the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cornwall's Mebyon Kernow, Ireland's Sinn F\u00e9in, Wales's Plaid Cymru, Galicia's Galician Nationalist Bloc, the Awami League in Bangladesh, the African National Congress in South Africa and numerous movements in Eastern Europe.\nNational-anarchism.\nAmong the first advocates of national-anarchism were Hans Cany, Peter T\u00f6pfer and former National Front activist Troy Southgate, founder of the National Revolutionary Faction, a since disbanded British-based organization which cultivated links to certain far-left and far-right circles in the United Kingdom and in post-Soviet states, not to be confused with the national-anarchism of the Black Ram Group. In the United Kingdom, national-anarchists worked with \"Albion Awake\", \"Alternative Green\" (published by former \"Green Anarchist\" editor Richard Hunt) and Jonathan Boulter to develop the Anarchist Heretics Fair. Those national-anarchists cite their influences primarily from Mikhail Bakunin, William Godwin, Peter Kropotkin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner and Leo Tolstoy.\nA position developed in Europe during the 1990s, national-anarchist groups have seen arisen worldwide, most prominently in Australia (New Right Australia/New Zealand), Germany (International National Anarchism) and the United States (BANA). National-anarchism has been described as a radical right-wing nationalist ideology which advocates racial separatism and white racial purity. National-anarchists claim to syncretize neotribal ethnic nationalism with philosophical anarchism, mainly in their support for a stateless society whilst rejecting anarchist social philosophy. The main ideological innovation of national-anarchism is its anti-state palingenetic ultranationalism. National-anarchists advocate homogeneous communities in place of the nation state. National-anarchists claim that those of different ethnic or racial groups would be free to develop separately in their own tribal communes while striving to be politically meritocratic, economically non-capitalist, ecologically sustainable and socially and culturally traditional.\nAlthough the term \"national-anarchism\" dates back as far as the 1920s, the contemporary national-anarchist movement has been put forward since the late 1990s by British political activist Troy Southgate, who positions it as being \"beyond left and right\". The few scholars who have studied national-anarchism conclude that it represents a further evolution in the thinking of the radical right rather than an entirely new dimension on the political spectrum. National-anarchism is considered by anarchists as being a rebranding of totalitarian fascism and an oxymoron due to the inherent contradiction of anarchist philosophy of anti-fascism, abolition of unjustified hierarchy, dismantling of national borders and universal equality between different nationalities as being incompatible with the idea of a synthesis between anarchism and fascism.\nNational-anarchism has elicited scepticism and outright hostility from both left-wing and far-right critics. Critics, including scholars, accuse national-anarchists of being nothing more than white nationalists who promote a communitarian and racialist form of ethnic and racial separatism while wanting the militant chic of calling themselves \"anarchists\" without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim, including the anti-racist egalitarian anarchist philosophy and the contributions of Jewish anarchists. Some scholars are sceptical that implementing national-anarchism would result in an expansion of freedom and describe it as an authoritarian anti-statism that would result in authoritarianism and oppression, only on a smaller scale.\nNativist nationalism.\nNativist nationalism is a type of nationalism similar to creole or territorial types of nationalism, but which defines belonging to a nation solely by being born on its territory. In countries where strong nativist nationalism exists, people who were not born in the country are seen as lesser nationals than those who were born there and are called \"immigrants\" even if they became naturalized. It is cultural as people will never see a foreign-born person as one of them and is legal as such people are banned for life from holding certain jobs, especially government jobs. In scholarly studies, \"nativism\" is a standard technical term, although those who hold this political view do not typically accept the label. . . . do not consider themselves nativists. For them it is a negative term and they rather consider themselves as 'Patriots'.\"\nRacial nationalism.\nRacial nationalism is an ideology that advocates a racial definition of national identity. Racial nationalism seeks to preserve a given race through policies such as banning race mixing and the immigration of other races. Specific examples are black nationalism and white nationalism.\nReligious nationalism.\nReligious nationalism is the relationship of nationalism to a particular religious belief, dogma, or affiliation where a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation. Saudi Arabian, Iranian, Egyptian, Iraqi, American, Indian and the Pakistani-Islamic nationalism (Two-Nation Theory) are some examples.\nTerritorial nationalism.\nSome nationalists exclude certain groups. Some nationalists, defining the national community in ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or religious terms (or a combination of these), may then seek to deem certain minorities as not truly being a part of the 'national community' as they define it. Sometimes a mythic homeland is more important for the national identity than the actual territory occupied by the nation.\nTerritorial nationalists assume that all inhabitants of a particular nation owe allegiance to their country of birth or adoption. A sacred quality is sought in the nation and in the popular memories it evokes. Citizenship is idealized by territorial nationalists. A criterion of a territorial nationalism is the establishment of a mass, public culture based on common values, codes and traditions of the population.\nSports nationalism.\nSport spectacles like football's World Cup command worldwide audiences as nations battle for supremacy and the fans invest intense support for their national team. Increasingly people have tied their loyalties and even their cultural identity to national teams. The globalization of audiences through television and other media has generated revenues from advertisers and subscribers in the billions of dollars, as the FIFA Scandals of 2015 revealed. Jeff Kingston looks at football, the Commonwealth Games, baseball, cricket, and the Olympics and finds that, \"The capacity of sports to ignite and amplify nationalist passions and prejudices is as extraordinary as is their power to console, unify, uplift and generate goodwill.\" The phenomenon is evident across most of the world. The British Empire strongly emphasized sports among its soldiers and agents across the world, and often the locals joined in enthusiastically. It established a high prestige competition in 1930, named the British Empire Games from 1930\u201350, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 1954\u201366, British Commonwealth Games from 1970\u201374 and since then the Commonwealth Games.\nThe French Empire was not far behind the British in the use of sports to strengthen colonial solidarity with France. Colonial officials promoted and subsidized gymnastics, table games, and dance and helped football spread to French colonies.\nPandemic nationalism.\nHarris Mylonas and Ned Whalley co-edited a special issue on \"pandemic nationalism\" exploring the relationship between nationalism and the COVID-19 pandemic. While nationalism unquestionably helped overcome collective action problems within state borders during the pandemic, it has undermined them at the global scale. The most clear example being been the abject failure of international organizations to coordinate an appropriate response. As they put it, \"During the pandemic, a nationalist human calculus has prevailed. Solidarity has been extended to co-nationals but has been less forthcoming beyond that point. All states have responded by turning inward. Border closures have been at the heart of mitigation efforts from the very beginning, and lockdowns legitimated and often enforced through national and patriotic discourses.\"\nCriticism.\nCritics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a nation, or whether a nation is a legitimate unit of political rule. Nationalists hold that the boundaries of a nation and a state should coincide with one another, thus nationalism tends to oppose multiculturalism. It can also lead to conflict when more than one national group finds itself claiming rights to a particular territory or seeking to take control of the state.\nPhilosopher A. C. Grayling describes nations as artificial constructs, \"their boundaries drawn in the blood of past wars\". He argues that \"there is no country on earth which is not home to more than one different but usually coexisting culture. Cultural heritage is not the same thing as national identity\".\nNationalism is considered by its critics to be inherently divisive, as adherents may draw upon and highlight perceived differences between people, emphasizing an individual's identification with their own nation. They also consider the idea to be potentially oppressive, because it can submerge individual identity within a national whole and give elites or political leaders potential opportunities to manipulate or control the masses. Much of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation. The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. However, even in that early stage there was an ideological critique of nationalism which has developed into several forms of internationalism and anti-nationalism. The Islamic revival of the 20th century also produced an Islamist critique of the nation-state. (see Pan-Islamism)\nAt the end of the 19th century, Marxists and other socialists and communists (such as Rosa Luxemburg) produced political analyses that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from Vladimir Lenin (a communist) to J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national self-determination.\nIn his classic essay on the topic, George Orwell distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place. More abstractly, nationalism is \"power-hunger tempered by self-deception\". For Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:\nThere are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.\nIn the liberal political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian Lord Acton put the case for \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, places country above moral principles and creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism. Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as Michael Walzer, Isaiah Berlin, Charles Taylor and David Miller emphasizing that a liberal society needs to be based in a stable nation state.\nThe pacifist critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of some nationalist movements, the associated militarism, and on conflicts between nations inspired by jingoism or chauvinism. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. British pacifist Bertrand Russell criticized nationalism for diminishing the individual's capacity to judge his or her fatherland's foreign policy. Albert Einstein stated that \"Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind\". Jiddu Krishnamurti stated that \"Nationalism is merely the glorification of tribalism\".\nTranshumanists have also expressed their opposition to nationalism, to the extent that some transhumanists believe national identities should be dissolved entirely. The influential transhumanist FM-2030 refused to identify with any nationality, referring to himself as 'universal'. Furthermore, in \"The Transhumanist Handbook\", Kate Levchuk stated that a transhumanist \"doesn't believe in nationality\"."}

{"id": "21754", "revid": "41450519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21754", "title": "Nation", "text": "A nation is a community of people formed on the basis of a combination of shared features such as language, history, ethnicity, culture and/or society. A nation is thus the collective identity of a group of people understood as defined by those features. Some nations are equated with ethnic groups (see ethnic nationalism) and some are equated with affiliation to a social and political constitution (see civic nationalism and multiculturalism). A nation is generally more overtly political than an ethnic group. A nation has also been defined as a cultural-political community that has become conscious of its autonomy, unity and particular interests.\nThe consensus among scholars is that nations are socially constructed and historically contingent. Throughout history, people have had an attachment to their kin group and traditions, territorial authorities and their homeland, but nationalism \u2013 the belief that state and nation should align as a nation state \u2013 did not become a prominent ideology until the end of the 18th century. There are three notable perspectives on how nations developed. Primordialism (perennialism), which reflects popular conceptions of nationalism but has largely fallen out of favour among academics, proposes that there have always been nations and that nationalism is a natural phenomenon. Ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a dynamic, evolving phenomenon and stresses the importance of symbols, myths and traditions in the development of nations and nationalism. Modernization theory, which has superseded primordialism as the dominant explanation of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible.\nProponents of modernization theory describe nations as \"imagined communities\", a term coined by Benedict Anderson. A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections and that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences themselves as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet. Nationalism is consequently seen an \"invented tradition\" in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity. A nation's foundational \"story\" may be built around a combination of ethnic attributes, values and principles, and may be closely connected to narratives of belonging.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe English word \"nation\" came from the Latin \"natio\", supine of verb \"nascar\" \u00ab to birth \u00bb (supine : \"natum\"), through French. In Latin, \"natio\" represents the children of the same birth and also a human group of same origin. By Cicero, \"natio\" is used for \"people\". Old French word \"nacion\" \u2013 meaning \"birth\" (\"naissance\"), \"place of origin\" \u2013, which in turn originates from the Latin word \"natio\" (\"n\u0101t\u012d\u014d\") literally meaning \"birth\".\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" defines a nation as follows:\nnation, \"n.\" (14c) 1. A large group of people having a common origin, language, and tradition and usu. constituting a political entity. \u2022 When a nation is coincident with a state, the term \"nation-state\" is often used...\n2. A community of people inhabiting a defined territory and organized under an independent government; a sovereign political state...\nThe word \"nation\" is sometimes used as synonym for:\nThus the phrase \"nations of the world\" could be referring to the top-level governments (as in the name for the United Nations), various large geographical territories, or various large ethnic groups of the planet.\nDepending on the meaning of \"nation\" used, the term \"nation state\" could be used to distinguish larger states from small city states, or could be used to distinguish multinational states from those with a single ethnic group.\nMedieval nations.\nSusan Reynolds has argued that many European medieval kingdoms were nations in the modern sense except that political participation in nationalism was available only to a limited prosperous and literate class.\nAdrian Hastings has claimed that England's Anglo-Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions. He argues that Alfred the Great, in particular, drew on biblical nationalism, using biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into Old English to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the Norman conquest) beginning with the translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s, positing that English nationalism and the English nation have been continuous since that time.\nThe Medieval Bulgarian nation is another possible example. Danubian Bulgaria was founded in 680-681 as a continuation of Great Bulgaria. After the adoption of Orthodox Christianity in 864 it became one of the cultural centres of Slavic Europe. Its leading cultural position was consolidated with the invention of the Cyrillic script in its capital Preslav at the eve of the 10th century. The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy in the country had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighbouring cultures and it also stimulated the development of a distinct ethnic identity. A symbiosis was carried out between the numerically weak Bulgars and the numerous Slavic tribes in that broad area from the Danube to the north, to the Aegean Sea to the south, and from the Adriatic Sea to the west, to the Black Sea to the east, who accepted the common ethnonym \"Bulgarians\". During the 10th century the Bulgarians established a form of national identity that was far from modern nationalism but helped them to survive as a distinct entity through the centuries.\nAnother example of Medieval nationalism is the Declaration of Arbroath (1320), a document produced by Scottish nobles and clergy during the Scottish Wars of Independence. The purpose of the document was to demonstrate to the Pope that Scotland was indeed a nation of its own, with its own unique culture, history and language and that it was indeed an older nation than England. The document went on to justify the actions of Robert the Bruce and his forces in resisting the occupation and to chastise the English for having violated Scottish sovereignty without justification. The propaganda campaign supplemented a military campaign on the part of the Bruce, which after the Battle of Bannockburn was successful and eventually resulted in the end of England's occupation and recognition of Scottish independence on the part of the English crown. The document is widely seen as an early example of both Scottish nationalism and popular sovereignty.\nAnthony Kaldellis asserts in \"Hellenism in Byzantium\" (2008) that what is called the Byzantine Empire was the Roman Empire transformed into a nation-state in the Middle Ages.\nAzar Gat is among the scholars who argue that China, Korea and Japan were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.\nUse of term \"nationes\" by medieval universities and other medieval institutions.\nA significant early use of the term \"nation\", as \"natio\", occurred at Medieval universities to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the University of Paris, who were all born within a \"pays\", spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, Jean Gerson was elected twice as a procurator for the French \"natio\". The University of Prague adopted the division of students into \"nationes\": from its opening in 1349 the \"studium generale\" which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Polish \"nations\".\nIn a similar way, the \"nationes\" were segregated by the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem, who maintained at Rhodes the hostels from which they took their name \"where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion\", as the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur noted in 1436.\nEarly modern nations.\nIn his article, \"The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism\", Philip S. Gorski argues that the first modern nation-state was the Dutch Republic, created by a fully modern political nationalism rooted in the model of biblical nationalism. In a 2013 article \"Biblical nationalism and the sixteenth-century states\", Diana Muir Appelbaum expands Gorski's argument to apply to a series of new, Protestant, sixteenth-century nation states. A similar, albeit broader, argument was made by Anthony D. Smith in his books, \"Chosen Peoples: Sacred Sources of National Identity\" and \"Myths and Memories of the Nation\".\nIn her book \"Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity\", Liah Greenfeld argued that nationalism was invented in England by 1600. According to Greenfeld, England was \u201cthe first nation in the world\".\nSocial science.\nScholars in the 19th and early 20th century offered constructivist criticisms of primordial theories about nations. A prominent lecture by Ernest Renan, \"What is a Nation?\", argues that a nation is \"a daily referendum\", and that nations are based as much on what the people jointly forget as on what they remember. Carl Darling Buck argued in a 1916 study, \"Nationality is essentially subjective, an active sentiment of unity, within a fairly extensive group, a sentiment based upon real but diverse factors, political, geographical, physical, and social, any or all of which may be present in this or that case, but no one of which must be present in all cases.\"\nIn the late 20th century, many social scientists argued that there were two types of nations, the civic nation of which French republican society was the principal example and the ethnic nation exemplified by the German peoples. The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and ethnic origins, that differentiate them from people of other nations. On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the French Revolution and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centred in a willingness to \"live together\", this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation. This is the vision, among others, of Ernest Renan.\nDebate about a potential future of nations.\nThere is an ongoing debate about the future of nations \u2212 about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.\nThe theory of the clash of civilizations lies in direct contrast to cosmopolitan theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, people's cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post\u2013Cold War world.\nThe theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture at the American Enterprise Institute, which was then developed in a 1993 \"Foreign Affairs\" article titled \"The Clash of Civilizations?\", in response to Francis Fukuyama's 1992 book, \"The End of History and the Last Man\". Huntington later expanded his thesis in a 1996 book \"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order\".\nHuntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post\u2013Cold War period. Some theorists and writers argued that human rights, liberal democracy and capitalist free market economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post\u2013Cold War world. Specifically, Francis Fukuyama, in \"The End of History and the Last Man\", argued that the world had reached a Hegelian \"end of history\".\nHuntington believed that while the age of ideology had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.\nPostnationalism is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to its aspects including economic globalization, a rise in importance of multinational corporations, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of socio-political power from national authorities to supranational entities, such as multinational corporations, the United Nations and the European Union and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the Internet. However attachment to citizenship and national identities often remains important.\nJan Zielonka of the University of Oxford states that \"the future structure and exercise of political power will resemble the medieval model more than the Westphalian one\" with the latter being about \"concentration of power, sovereignty and clear-cut identity\" and neo-medievalism meaning \"overlapping authorities, divided sovereignty, multiple identities and governing institutions, and fuzzy borders\"."}

It is sometimes referred as ' or ', its main dialect, through synecdoche.\nAccording to the South African National Census of 2011, it is the first language of over 4.6 million (9.1%) people, making it the 5th most spoken language in South Africa. The Sepedi language is spoken most commonly in Mpumalanga, Gauteng and the Limpopo provinces.\nName.\nThe Northern Sotho written language was based largely on the Sepedi dialect. Missionaries studied this dialect the most closely and first developed the orthography in 1860 by Alexander Merensky, Grutzner and Gerlachshoop. This subsequently provided a common writing system for 20 or more varieties of the Sotho-Tswana languages spoken in the former Transvaal, and also helped lead to \"Sepedi\" being used as the umbrella term for the entire language family. However, there are objections to this synecdoche by other Northern Sotho dialect speakers, such as speakers of the Modjadji's Lobedu dialect.\nOther varieties of Northern Sotho.\nNorthern Sotho can be subdivided into Highveld-Sotho, which consists of comparatively recent immigrants mostly from the west and southwest parts of South Africa, and Lowveld-Sotho, which consists of a combination of immigrants from the north of South Africa and Sotho inhabitants of longer standing. Like other Sotho-Tswana people their languages are named after totemic animals and, sometimes, by alternating or combining these with the names of famous chiefs.\nThe Highveld-Sotho.\nThe group consists of the following dialects:\nThe Lowveld-Sotho.\nThe group consists of the Lobedu, Narene, Phalaborwa (Malatji), Mogoboya, Kone, Kgaga, Pulana, Pai, and Kutswe.\nHistory.\nBefore Moshoeshoe and his Basotho nation of Lesotho, Basotho people were there. Moshoshoe didn't found Basotho, but he founded a nation made up of Sesotho speaking people from different Sesotho speaking clans in which the British imperialist in Southern Africa erroneously called the Basotho nation cutting them off from the rest of other Basothos outside Lesotho in the Orange Free State and Transvaal in present-day South Africa, Botswana as if Moshoshoe and his people were unique from other Basotho people. Basotho people were there before Moshoshoe, the son of Mokhachane of another Basotho clan of the Bamokoteli clan, united the smaller and vulnerable clans of Basothos under his Bakwena clan leadership during the Shaka wars of difaqane after other Basothos have migrated to different directions from their cradle in Ntswanatsatsi. Moshoshoe and his Bakwena clan and the rest of the other Basotho clan originate from Ntswanatsatsi in present-day South Africa. Families moved away from each other in Ntswanatsatsi and started clans using a totem as a symbol of their clan (like a crocodile (Koena) which Moshoshoe' ancestors used) and different families moved to different directions within precolonial South Africa under different leadership. Under different leadership some settled in the Western side, present-day North West Province others spread around Ntswanatsatsi to the present-day Free State and Lesotho, others to present-day Botswana others to present-day Zambia, others moved to the present day Gauteng in South Africa and they became patriarchs of the founding fathers of Bakgatla, which also gave birth to Northern Sotho, which, in turn, gave birth to different Northern clans with their dialects like BaPedi, Batlokwa, Babirwa, etc and others ended up in inter-marrying with other tribes. They moved next to and mingled with like Swatis, Vendas, Tsongas and Ngunis, and, in some places, these Northern Basotho' Sotho was diluted by the influence of these tribe they found in the area, they moved into and lived alongside. This is what happened to a subgroup of Northern Basotho who end up becoming Mapulana with their Sesotho influenced by Swati. Also some of the Northern Basotho having a common denominator of \"apa\" (meaning talk) with Vendas, I mean Balovedu, BaGubu and Babirwa of Bobirwa in the Southern part of Botswana near the Zimbabwean border. All these Northern Sotho clans have their chief of leader, they never had a paramount king, so, it would be absurd to call them BaPedi because the BaPedi kings had never been their kings. They did their own things from Ramokgopha of Batlhokwa, Malatji of Phalaborwa, Malebogo of Bahanawa, Matlala, etc, and they were never part of the Pedi kingdom.\nClassification.\nNorthern Sotho is one of the Sotho languages of the Bantu family.\nAlthough Northern Sotho shares the name \"Sotho\" with Southern Sotho, the two groups have less in common with each other than they have with Setswana.\nNorthern Sotho is also closely related to Setswana, sheKgalagari and siLozi. It is a standardised dialect, amalgamating several distinct varieties or dialects.\nMost Khelobedu speakers only learn to speak Sepedi at school, as such Sepedi is only a second or third language and foreign to them like English and Afrikaans. Khelobedu is a written language. Khilovedu dictionary, THALUSAMANDWI YA KHILOVEDU was published in 2018 by Kgothatso Seshayi. The first KhiLovedu Novel, LEKHEKHESHA was published in 2018 by Eliya Monyela. The first KhiLovedu poetry book, ZWIRETO ZWA KHELOBEDU was published and launched in 2020 by KhiLovedu poet Makgwekgwe Waa-Mampeule. As of October 2021 a translation of the Christian Bible is being undertaken by VALODAGOMA SOCIETY (BaLobedu think tank) and PANSALB (Pan South African Languages Board).\nThe monarch associated with this language community is Queen Modjadji (also known as the Rain Queen). Lobedu is spoken by a majority of people in the Greater Tzaneen, Greater Letaba, and BaPhalaborwa municipalities, and a minority in Greater Giyani municipality, as well as in the Limpopo Province and Tembisa township in Gauteng. Its speakers are known as the Balobedu.\nSepulana () exists in unwritten form and forms part of the standard Northern Sotho. Sepulana is spoken in Bushbuckridge area by the MaPulana people.\nNorthern Sotho is also spoken by the Mohlala people.\nWriting system.\nSepedi is written in the Latin alphabet. The letter \"\u0161\" is used to represent the sound [] (\"sh\" is used in the trigraph \"tsh\" to represent an aspirated \"ts\" sound). The circumflex accent can be added to the letters e and o to distinguish their different sounds, but it is mostly used in language reference books. Some word prefixes, especially in verbs, are written separately from the stem.\nPhonology.\nConsonants.\nWithin nasal consonant compounds, the first nasal consonant sound is recognized as syllabic. Words such as \"nthu\u0161e\" \"help me\", are pronounced as . /n/ can also be pronounced as following a velar consonant.\nUrban varieties of Northern Sotho, such as Pretoria Sotho (actually a derivative of Tswana), have acquired clicks in an ongoing process of such sounds spreading from Nguni languages.\nVocabulary.\nSome examples of Sepedi words and phrases:"}
{"id": "21757", "revid": "18872885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21757", "title": "New York Giants", "text": "The New York Giants are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area. The Giants compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, west of New York City. The stadium is shared with the New York Jets. The Giants are headquartered and practice at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center, also in the Meadowlands.\nThe Giants were one of five teams that joined the NFL in 1925, and they are the only one of that group still existing, as well as the league's longest-established team in the Northeastern United States. The team ranks third among all NFL franchises with eight NFL championship titles: four in the pre\u2013Super Bowl era (1927, 1934, 1938, 1956) and four since the advent of the Super Bowl (XXI (1986), XXV (1990), XLII (2007), and XLVI (2011)), along with more championship appearances than any other team, with 19 overall appearances. Their championship tally is surpassed only by the Green Bay Packers (13) and the Chicago Bears (9). Throughout their history, the Giants have featured 29 Hall of Fame players, including NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winners Mel Hein, Frank Gifford, Y. A. Tittle, and Lawrence Taylor.\nTo distinguish themselves from the professional baseball team of the same name, the football team was incorporated as the \"New York National League Football Company, Inc.\" in 1929 and then changed to \"New York Football Giants, Inc.\" in 1937. While the baseball team moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season, the football team continues to legally use it as its corporate name, which the team is often referred to by fans and sportscasters alike. The team has also acquired several nicknames, including \"Big Blue\", the \"G-Men\", and the \"Jints\", an intentionally mangled contraction seen frequently in the \"New York Post\" and \"New York Daily News\", originating from the baseball team when they were based in New York. In addition, the team as a whole is occasionally referred to as the \"Big Blue Wrecking Crew\", even though this moniker primarily and originally refers to the Giants defensive unit during the 1980s and early-1990s.\nThe team's heated rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933, and has been called the best rivalry in the NFL in the 21st century.\nFranchise history.\nMara family era (1925\u20131990).\nThe Giants played their first game as an away game against All New Britain in New Britain, Connecticut, on October 4, 1925. They defeated New Britain 26\u20130 in front of a crowd of 10,000. The Giants were successful in their first season, finishing with an 8\u20134 record.\nEarl Potteiger years (1927\u20131928).\nNFL champions (1927).\nIn its third season, the team finished with the best record in the league at 11\u20131\u20131 and was awarded the NFL title. After a disappointing fourth season (1928) owner Tim Mara bought the entire squad of the Detroit Wolverines, principally to acquire star quarterback Benny Friedman, and merged the two teams under the Giants name.\nIn 1930, there were still many who questioned the quality of the professional game, claiming the college \"amateurs\" played with more intensity than professionals. In December 1930, the Giants played a team of Notre Dame All Stars at the Polo Grounds to raise money for the unemployed of New York City. It was also an opportunity to establish the skill and prestige of the pro game. Knute Rockne reassembled his Four Horsemen along with the stars of his 1924 Championship squad and told them to score early, then defend. Rockne, like much of the public, thought little of pro football and expected an easy win. But from the beginning it was a one-way contest, with Friedman running for two Giant touchdowns and Hap Moran passing for another. Notre Dame failed to score. When it was all over, Coach Rockne told his team, \"That was the greatest football machine I ever saw. I am glad none of you got hurt.\" The game raised $100,000 for the homeless, and is often credited with establishing the legitimacy of the professional game for those who were critical. It also was the last game the legendary Rockne ever coached; he was killed in an airplane crash on March 31, 1931.\nSteve Owen years (1931\u20131953).\nIn a 16-year span from 1931 to 1947, the Giants qualified to play in the NFL championship game 8 times, winning twice. During this period the Giants were led by Hall of Fame coach Steve Owen, and Hall of Fame players Mel Hein, Red Badgro, and Tuffy Leemans. In 1933 the Giants faced the Chicago Bears in the championship game and were defeated 23-21. \nNFL champions (1934).\nThe famous \"Sneakers Game\" was played in this era where the Giants defeated the Chicago Bears on an icy field in the 1934 NFL Championship Game, while wearing sneakers for better traction. The team would return to the championship game the following year but would fall to the Detroit Lions 26-7.\nNFL champions (1938).\nThe giants captured their third NFL championship in 1938 with a 23\u201317 win over the Green Bay Packers. Both teams returned to the championship game the following year in 1939, with the Packers shutting out the Giants 27-0.\nThe period also featured the 1944 Giants, which are ranked as the #1 defensive team in NFL history, \"...a truly awesome unit\". They gave up only 7.5 points per game (a record that still stands) and shut out five of their 10 opponents, though they lost 14-7 to the Green Bay Packers in the 1944 NFL Championship Game. The Giants played the Detroit Lions to a scoreless tie on November 7, 1943. To this day, no NFL game played since then has ended in a scoreless tie. The Giants were particularly successful from the latter half of the 1930s until the United States entry into World War II.\nJim Lee Howell years (1954\u20131960).\nNFL champions (1956).\nThe Giants won their next championship in 1956, the first year the team began playing at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx borough of New York City. Aided by a number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players such as running back Frank Gifford, linebacker Sam Huff, and offensive tackle Roosevelt Brown, as well as all-pro running back Alex Webster. The Giants' 1956 championship team not only included players who would eventually find their way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but a Hall of Fame coaching staff, as well. Head coach Jim Lee Howell's staff had Vince Lombardi coaching the offense and Tom Landry coaching the defense. From 1958 to 1963, the Giants played in the NFL Championship Game five times, but failed to win. Most significantly, the Giants played the Colts in the 1958 NFL Championship Game, which is considered a event in the history of the NFL. The game, which the Giants lost in overtime 23\u201317, is often called \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\" and is considered one of the most important events in furthering the NFL's popularity. The following year, they lost the championship to the Colts again, giving up a 9\u20137 fourth-quarter lead en route to a 31\u201316 loss.\nAllie Sherman years (1961\u20131968).\nBoth the 1961 and 1962 championship game matched the Giants up against the Green Bay Packers, with the Giants losing both 37\u20130 and 16\u20137 respectively. In 1963, led by league MVP quarterback Y. A. Tittle, who threw a then-NFL record 36 touchdown passes, the Giants advanced to the NFL Championship Game, where they lost to the Bears 14\u201310 for their third consecutive championship loss, as well as their fifth loss in the title game in 6 years.\nFrom 1964 to 1978, the Giants registered only two winning seasons and no playoff appearances. With players, such as Tittle and Gifford approaching their mid 30s, the team declined rapidly, finishing 2\u201310\u20132 in 1964. They rebounded with a 7\u20137 record in 1965, before compiling a league-worst 1\u201312\u20131 record, and allowing more than 500 points on defense in 1966. During the 1969 preseason, the Giants lost their first meeting with the New York Jets, 37\u201314, in front of 70,874 fans at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. Following the game, Wellington Mara fired coach Allie Sherman, and replaced him with former Giants fullback Alex Webster.\nIn 1967, the team acquired quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings. Despite having several respectable seasons with Tarkenton at quarterback, including a 7\u20137 finish in 1967 and 9\u20135 in 1970, the Giants traded him back to the Vikings after a 4\u201310 finish in 1971. Tarkenton would go on to lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and earn a place in the Hall of Fame, while the Giants suffered through one of the worst stretches in their history, winning only 23 games from 1973 to 1979. Before the 1976 season, the Giants tried to revive a weak offense by replacing retired RB Ron Johnson with future Hall of Fame fullback Larry Csonka, but Csonka was often injured and ineffective during his 3 years in New York. The 1977 season featured a roster which included three rookie quarterbacks.\nThe Giants were allowed to play their home games at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut in 1973 and 1974, and at Shea Stadium (home of the Mets and Jets) in Queens, New York in 1975, due to the renovation of Yankee Stadium. They finally moved into their own dedicated state-of-the-art stadium in 1976, when they moved into Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey, located 5 miles west of New York City. One of the low points during this period was the play known as the \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\", which occurred in 1978. With the Giants trying to kill the clock and secure a win against the Philadelphia Eagles, offensive coordinator, Bob Gibson, chose to call a running play. This resulted in \"The Fumble\" by QB Joe Pisarcik that was returned for a game-winning touchdown by the Eagles' Herman Edwards.\nThe Giants' front office operations were complicated by a long-standing feud between Wellington Mara and his nephew, Tim Mara. Jack Mara had died in 1965, leaving his share of the club to his son Tim. Wellington and Tim's personal styles and their visions for the club clashed, and eventually they stopped talking to each other. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle intervened and appointed a neutral general manager, George Young, allowing the club to operate more smoothly. The feud became moot on February 20, 1991, when Tim Mara sold his shares in the club to Preston Robert Tisch.\nIn 1979, the Giants began the steps that would, in time, return them to the pinnacle of the NFL. These included the drafting of quarterback Phil Simms in 1979, and linebacker Lawrence Taylor in 1981. In 1981, Taylor won the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year awards and the Giants made the playoffs for the first time since 1963. One of the few bright spots during this time was the team's excellent linebackers, who were known as the Crunch Bunch. After the strike-shortened 1982 season, in which they finished 4\u20135, head coach Ray Perkins resigned to succeed the legendary Bear Bryant as head coach at the University of Alabama. In a change that would prove crucial in the coming years, he was replaced by the team's defensive coordinator, Bill Parcells.\nBill Parcells years (1983\u20131990).\nIn 1983, Bill Parcells was promoted to head coach from defensive coordinator. One of his first moves was to change his starting quarterback, sitting the injury-prone and struggling Phil Simms (who had missed the entire 1982 season with an injury) and electing instead to go with Scott Brunner, who had gone 4-5 as the starter in place of Simms in the strike-shortened previous season. Parcells went as far as to demote Simms to the third-string position, promoting Jeff Rutledge over Simms to be Brunner's backup. Parcells later said the move was a mistake and one he \"nearly paid for dearly\" as the team finished with a 3\u201312\u20131 record and his job security was called into question.\nIn the off-season the Giants released Brunner and named Simms the starter. The move paid off as the team won nine games and returned to the playoffs. After beating the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card Round, the Giants prepared for a showdown against top-seeded San Francisco. The 49ers defeated the Giants 21\u201310 in the Divisional Round.\nSuper Bowl XXI champions (1986).\nAfter 9\u20137 and 10\u20136 finishes in 1984 and 1985 respectively, the Giants compiled a 14\u20132 record in 1986 led by league MVP and Defensive Player of the Year Lawrence Taylor and the Big Blue Wrecking Crew defense. As of 2017, this is the Giants' best regular season record since the NFL began playing 16-game seasons in 1978. After clinching the top seed in the NFC, the Giants defeated the 49ers 49\u20133 in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs and the Redskins 17\u20130 in the NFC championship game, advancing to their first Super Bowl, Super Bowl XXI, against the Denver Broncos at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Led by MVP Simms who completed 22 of 25 passes for a Super Bowl record 88% completion percentage, they defeated the Broncos 39\u201320, to win their first championship since 1956. In addition to Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, the team was led during this period by head coach Bill Parcells, tight end Mark Bavaro, running back Joe Morris, and Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson.\nThe Giants struggled to a 6\u20139 record in the strike-marred 1987 season, due largely to a decline in the running game, as Morris managed only 658 yards behind an injury-riddled offensive line. The early portion of the 1988 season was marred by a scandal involving Lawrence Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine and was suspended for the first four games of the season for his second violation of the league's substance-abuse policy. Despite the controversy, the Giants finished 10\u20136, and Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks after his return from the suspension; however, the team missed the playoffs in their last game of the season. They surged to a 12\u20134 record in 1989, but lost to the Los Angeles Rams in their opening playoff game when Flipper Anderson caught a 47-yard touchdown pass to give the Rams a 19\u201313 overtime win.\nSuper Bowl XXV champions (1990).\nIn 1990, the Giants went 13\u20133 and, at the time, set an NFL record for fewest turnovers in a season (14). They defeated the San Francisco 49ers, who were attempting to win the Super Bowl for an unprecedented third straight year, 15\u201313 at San Francisco and then defeated the Buffalo Bills 20\u201319 in Super Bowl XXV.\nMara and Tisch era (1991\u2013present).\nFollowing the 1990 season, Parcells resigned as head coach and was replaced by the team's offensive-line coach Ray Handley. Handley served as coach for two disappointing seasons (1991 and 1992), which saw the Giants fall from Super Bowl champions to an 8\u20138 record in 1991 and a 6\u201310 record in 1992. He was fired following the 1992 season, and replaced by former Denver Broncos' coach Dan Reeves. In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor, two of the stars of the 1980s, played out the last seasons of their careers with steadily declining production. The Giants experienced a resurgent season with Reeves at the helm in 1993 however, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers as members of a playoff team.\nThe Giants initially struggled in the post Simms/Taylor era. After starting 3\u20137 in 1994, the Giants won their final six games to finish 9\u20137 but missed the playoffs. Quarterback Dave Brown received heavy criticism throughout the season. Brown performed poorly the following two seasons, and the Giants struggled to 5\u201311 and 6\u201310 records. Reeves was fired following the 1996 season.\nJim Fassell years (1997\u20132003).\nIn 1997, the Giants named Jim Fassel, who had spent the previous season as offensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals, as their 16th head coach. Fassel named Danny Kanell the team's starting quarterback. The Giants finished the 1997 season with a record of 10\u20135\u20131 and qualified for the playoffs for the first time in four years. However, they lost in the Wild Card round to the Vikings at home. The following year, the Giants began the season 4\u20138 before rallying to finish the season 8\u20138. One of the notable games of that season was a win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in week 15, giving the Broncos their first loss of the season after starting 13\u20130.\nBefore the 1999 season, the Giants signed ex-Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins was the first-ever draft choice of the expansion Carolina Panthers in 1995, and led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game in his second season. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates, and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. The Giants finished the season with a 7\u20139 record, Fassel's first losing season as head coach.\nIn 2000, the Giants were looking to make the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. The Giants started the season 7\u20132, but suffered back-to-back home losses to St. Louis and Detroit to make their record 7\u20134 and call their playoff prospects into question. At a press conference following the Giants' loss to Detroit, Fassel guaranteed that \"this team is going to the playoffs\". The Giants responded, winning the rest of their regular season games to finish the season 12\u20134 and clinch the top seed in the NFC. In the Divisional Round, the Giants beat the Philadelphia Eagles 20\u201310 at home to qualify for the NFC Championship Game, in which they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 41\u20130. They advanced to play the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Though the Giants went into halftime down only 10\u20130, the Ravens dominated the second half. Their defense harassed Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins completing only 15 of 39 passes for 112\u00a0yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34\u20137.\nAfter a disappointing 7\u20139 record in 2001, the Giants finished the 2002 season with a record of 10\u20136, qualifying for the playoffs as a wild card. This set up a meeting with the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park in the Wild Card round. The Giants built up a sizable lead throughout the game, and led 38\u201314 with 4:27 left in the third quarter. However, San Francisco rallied to win the game by one point, with the final score of 39\u201338.\nAfter a dismal 2003 season in which the Giants finished with a 4\u201312 record, Jim Fassel was released by the Giants. His head coaching record with the Giants during this time was 58\u201353\u20131.\nTom Coughlin years (2004\u20132015).\nIn 2004, three years after their last Super Bowl appearance, Fassel was replaced by Tom Coughlin. Although Collins had several solid seasons as the Giants quarterback, he experienced his share of struggles. In 2004, the Giants completed a draft day trade for University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning. Manning became the team's starting quarterback in the middle of the 2004 season, taking over for Kurt Warner. During the three-year period from 2004 to 2006, Tom Coughlin's Giants compiled a 25\u201323 regular season record and two appearances in the Wild Card Round \u2014 both losses (to the Carolina Panthers in 2005 and to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2006.) and spawned intense media scrutiny concerning the direction of the team. During this period in their history, standout players included defensive end Michael Strahan, who set the NFL single season record in sacks in 2001, and running back Tiki Barber, who set a team record for rushing yards in a season in 2005. Barber retired at the end of the 2006 season.\nSuper Bowl XLII champions (2007).\nGoing into 2007, the Giants had made the playoffs in back-to-back seasons. In 2007, the Giants became the third NFL franchise to win at least 600 games when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 31\u201310 on \"Monday Night Football\". For the 2007 season, the NFL scheduled the Giants' road game against the Miami Dolphins on October 28 in London's Wembley Stadium; this was the first NFL regular season game to be played outside of North America. The Giants defeated the Dolphins, 13\u201310. The Giants finished 10\u20136, and became NFC Champions after defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys, and Green Bay Packers in the NFC Playoffs. They set a record for most consecutive road wins in a single season with 10 (a streak which ended with a loss to the Cleveland Browns during week 6 of the 2008 season).\nThe Patriots (18\u20130) entered the Super Bowl undefeated and were 12 point favorites going into game weekend. The Giants defeated the Patriots 17\u201314 in Super Bowl XLII, aided by the famous \"Manning to Tyree\" pass. On this famous play, Manning escaped the grip of several Patriots defensive linemen, stepped up in the pocket, and heaved the ball down the middle of the field to a double-covered David Tyree. With Rodney Harrison, a Patriots defensive back, all over Tyree, David managed to hold on to the ball by holding it on his helmet until he fell to the ground. This catch set up a Manning to Plaxico Burress touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to put the Giants in the lead. It was the third biggest upset by betting line in Super Bowl history (the Baltimore Colts were favored by 17 over the New York Jets in Super Bowl III, and the St. Louis Rams were favored by 14 over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI). Co-owner John Mara described it as \"the greatest victory in the history of this franchise, without question\".\nThe Giants began the 2008 season with a record of 11\u20131, but lost three of their last four regular season games partially due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to wide receiver Plaxico Burress. However, the Giants still won the NFC East with a record of 12\u20134, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC after beating the Carolina Panthers for home-field advantage and a first-round bye. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the Giants lost 23\u201311 to the Philadelphia Eagles at home.\nIn 2009, the Giants opened a new training complex, the Timex Performance Center, also located in the Meadowlands. After starting 5\u20130 in the 2009 season, New York lost to the likewise undefeated New Orleans Saints at the Louisiana Superdome 48\u201327, beginning a four-game losing streak, in which they lost to the Arizona Cardinals 24\u201317, the San Diego Chargers 21\u201320 and the Philadelphia Eagles 40\u201317. The streak was broken with a 34\u201331 overtime victory against the Atlanta Falcons. On Thanksgiving night, they lost to the Denver Broncos 26\u20136. The Giants next beat the division-leading Dallas Cowboys. A week later, with a record of 7\u20135, they lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, 45\u201338. On December 27, the Giants lost to the Carolina Panthers 41\u20139 in their final game at Giants Stadium, and were eliminated from playoff eligibility. The Giants finished the season 8\u20138.\nFollowing the season, the Giants fired first-year defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan, and replaced him with the former Buffalo Bills interim head coach, Perry Fewell. The Giants defense finished 13th overall under Sheridan, giving up 324.9 yards per game, and the final two losses of the season against Carolina and Minnesota, in which the Giants gave up 85 points, ultimately led to the firing.\nIn 2010, the Giants moved from Giants Stadium into MetLife Stadium, then known as the \"New Meadowlands Stadium\". They won against the Carolina Panthers in the first game at New Meadowlands Stadium, but then lost to the Indianapolis Colts in the second \"Manning Bowl\", so-called due to Eli Manning's brother Peyton playing for the Colts. The Giants dropped one game to the Tennessee Titans before going on a five-game winning streak, beating the Chicago Bears, Houston Texans, Detroit Lions, Dallas Cowboys, and Seattle Seahawks. Before long, the Giants were 6\u20132, but lost two straight to division foes: to the Cowboys 33\u201320 at home, and to the Philadelphia Eagles on the road, putting the Giants in second place in the NFC East at 6\u20134. In first place was the Eagles, but at December 19 the two teams tied at 8\u20134, setting up a match for first place. The Giants were at home, and led 24\u20133 over the Eagles at halftime. The score was 31\u201310 with 5:40 left in the game, but Michael Vick led the Eagles to three touchdown drives to tie the game up at 31 with 40 seconds left. After a Giants three-and-out, Matt Dodge punted the ball to DeSean Jackson, who returned it for a touchdown, concluding the Giants' epic collapse. The next game, the Giants lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers 45\u201317, and at 9\u20136, they faced the Redskins. They had to win and have the Packers lose in order to get into the playoffs. The Giants won 17\u201314, but the Packers beat the Bears 10\u20133, so the Giants missed out on the playoffs again, ending a collapse in which the Giants went 4\u20134 in their last eight games.\nSuper Bowl XLVI champions (2011).\nDuring the 2011 preseason, the Giants lost Kevin Boss, Steve Smith, Rich Seubert, Keith Bulluck, Derek Hagan, and Pro Bowl center Shaun O'Hara to free agency. However, the season also saw the emergence of second-year wide receiver Victor Cruz and second-year tight end Jake Ballard. The Giants opened their season with a 28\u201314 loss to the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. However, the Giants secured a 6\u20132 record by the midpoint of the season, including road victories over the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots. The latter victory ended the Patriots' NFL record home-game winning streak, after a touchdown pass from Manning to Jake Ballard with 15 seconds left in the game.\nHowever, the Giants then suffered a four-game losing streak, including road losses against the resurgent San Francisco 49ers and the New Orleans Saints and home losses to the Eagles and the then-undefeated Green Bay Packers, to make their record 6\u20136 entering December. The Giants broke their losing streak with a tightly contested 37\u201334 road victory over the Cowboys on December 11 with Jason Pierre-Paul blocking a last second field goal attempt, but lost at home to the Washington Redskins the following week to make their record 7\u20137 with a Christmas Eve showdown against their crosstown rival New York Jets the following week. The Giants won, 29\u201314, and knocked the Eagles out of playoff contention, to set up a Week 17 home game against the Cowboys in which the winner would clinch the NFC East while the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. The game was flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants defeated the Cowboys, 31\u201314, and clinched the NFC East title and the fourth seed in the playoffs. Wide receiver Victor Cruz finished the regular season with 1,536 receiving yards, breaking the Giants franchise record previously held by Amani Toomer.\nOn January 8, 2012, in the first round of the playoffs, the Giants defeated the Atlanta Falcons 24\u20132. After giving up an early safety in the first half, quarterback Eli Manning threw for three consecutive touchdowns. Running backs Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs combined for 172 yards rushing, a season-high for the Giants. With the victory, the Giants advanced to the second round against the top-ranked Green Bay Packers.\nOn January 15, 2012, the Giants defeated the Green Bay Packers 37\u201320. Eli Manning threw for 330 yards and 3 touchdowns, two of which to wide receiver Hakeem Nicks. This earned the Giants a spot in the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2012, against the San Francisco 49ers. They won this game 20\u201317, in overtime, with Tynes scoring the winning field goal as he did four years earlier in the same game against the Packers.\nThe New York Giants won Super Bowl XLVI against the New England Patriots with a score of 21\u201317. The winning touchdown was preceded by a 38-yard reception by receiver Mario Manningham. As in Super Bowl XLII, Eli Manning was Super Bowl MVP, defeating the Patriots for a second time in the Super Bowl.\nAhmad Bradshaw scored the game-winning touchdown by falling into the end zone. The Patriots were allowing Bradshaw to get the touchdown so they would get the ball with some time remaining. When Eli Manning handed the ball to Bradshaw, he told him not to score. Bradshaw was about to fall down at the 1-yard line but his momentum carried him in, thus the \"reluctant touchdown.\"\nAs was the case in each of their four previous Super Bowl appearances, the Giants trailed at halftime. They are the only team in NFL history to have more than two second half, come-from-behind, Super Bowl victories (4). The Pittsburgh Steelers, who accomplished the feat in Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIV, are the only other team to do it more than once.\nThe Giants began the 2012 season with a home loss to the Dallas Cowboys, but rebounded to finish October with a 6\u20132 record and on a four-game winning streak that included a 26\u20133 road victory against the eventual NFC champion San Francisco 49ers. Following the arrival of Hurricane Sandy in the Northeastern United States, the Giants lost back-to-back games against the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals to fall to 6\u20134. Despite impressive blowout home victories over the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles, the Giants finished the season 9\u20137 and out of the playoffs. Quarterback Eli Manning, defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, wide receiver Victor Cruz, and guard Chris Snee represented the Giants at the Pro Bowl.\nThe 2013 season began with hope that the Giants could become the first team to play in the Super Bowl in their home stadium, as MetLife Stadium was scheduled to host Super Bowl XLVIII that February. However, the Giants' playoff hopes took a massive hit when they lost the first six games of the season. They rebounded to win the next four games in a row to improve to 4\u20136, but lost a critical home game to the Dallas Cowboys on a last-minute field goal. They finished the season 7\u20139 and with a losing record for the first time since 2004. The Giants drafted rookie wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in the 2014 NFL Draft, who would later go on to win the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award. However, the Giants missed the playoffs for a third straight season, finishing with a 6\u201310 record. The 2015 season was another disappointing campaign, as the Giants showcased a struggling defense and several late-game collapses. The Giants finished the season with a 6\u201310 record and missed the playoffs.\n2016\u2013present.\nOn January 14, 2016, the Giants announced that Ben McAdoo would become the team's head coach. He replaced Tom Coughlin, who had resigned the previous week. The Giants turned it around in 2016, ending their five-year playoff drought. The Giants later lost to the Green Bay Packers 38\u201313 in the Wild Card round.\nAfter having high expectations due to their 11\u20135 record in 2016, the Giants had an unexpected 0\u20135 start to the 2017 season, before pulling a massive upset versus the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High for their first win of the season. However, during the Week 5 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, Odell Beckham Jr. fractured his ankle, an injury that ended his season. During the same game, the Giants also lost wide receivers Brandon Marshall and Dwayne Harris to season-ending injuries. The season was also marred by the suspensions of Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Janoris Jenkins. The Giants finished the 2017 season with a 3\u201313 record, the second-worst in the league. This was also the first time since 1983 in which the Giants finished the regular season with three or less wins, and their worst record since the 16 game season was adopted in the NFL.\nThe season was also highlighted the controversial benching of longtime quarterback Eli Manning in Week 13, and the high-profile firings of head coach Ben McAdoo and General Manager Jerry Reese, who were the first mid-season staff firings since the 1976 Giants' season. Manning was eventually renamed the starter in Week 14. Subsequently, the disastrous season led to the team being awarded the second overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, which they utilized to select Saquon Barkley from Penn State. Despite Barkley's selection, several questions pertained into the following season around the team's offensive line and long-term future at quarterback.\nThe 2018 season began with Pat Shurmur being hired as the new head coach. Despite starting 1\u20137 for the second consecutive year, the Giants managed to marginally improve on their 3\u201313 campaign by finishing the season 5\u201311 in a 30-27 overtime win against the Chicago Bears. After defeating the Washington Redskins in Week 14, the Giants became the first team in NFL history to win 100 regular season games against an opponent. However, this ensured last place in the NFC East for the second straight year, marking the first time they were division rock bottom in back-to-back years since 1977 and 1978. The season was also highlighted by blown fourth-quarter leads which was similar to their 2015 team, where the Giants were in 12 one-possession games, and lost 8 of those by 7 points or less. Following the season's end, the team was placed to select sixth overall in the 2019 NFL Draft. Barkley impressed in his rookie season, breaking several NFL and Giants team records for a rookie, including having the most receptions by a running back (91), most rushing touchdowns (11), most rushing yards (1,307), and most touchdowns in a season (15). He was also selected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, alongside fellow teammates Olivier Vernon, Landon Collins, and Aldrick Rosas in addition to winning offensive rookie of the year honors.\nAfter the 2019 season, the Giants' longtime quarterback, Eli Manning, retired after spending 16 seasons with the organization, while the team finished the season with a 4\u201312 record. At the start of the 2020 season, Daniel Jones took over as starting quarterback as the Giants finished 6\u201310, while tight end Evan Engram and cornerback James Bradberry were named to the 2021 Pro Bowl as reserves.\nIn the 2021 season the Giants failed to improve on their 2020 record by finishing 4\u201313. Then after the season, general manager Dave Gettleman retired and head coach Joe Judge was fired. During the season the squad's starting quarterback Daniel Jones sprained his neck and was temporarily replaced in the lineup by Mike Glennon and then Jake Fromm.\nOn January 21, 2022, the team hired Joe Schoen as the team's general manager, and on January 28, hired Brian Daboll as the team's new head coach.\nChampionships.\nThe Giants have won a total of eight league championships: 1927, 1934, 1938, 1956, 1986, 1990, 2007 and 2011. The first four of those championships came in the pre-Super Bowl era. New York's eight championships put them third among all active and defunct NFL teams, trailing only the Green Bay Packers (13) and the Chicago Bears (9).\nNFL championships (pre-Super Bowl era).\nBefore the Super Bowl was instituted, the Giants won four officially recognized NFL championships.\nSuper Bowl championships.\nThe Giants have won four Super Bowls, tied with Green Bay for the fifth most behind Dallas, San Francisco (both with 5), and New England and Pittsburgh (6 each).\nNFC championships.\nThe Giants have won five NFC Championship Games, including two in overtime in 2007 and 2011.\nLogos and uniforms.\nWith nearly 100 years of team history, the Giants have used numerous uniforms and logos, while maintaining a consistent identity. The Giants' logos include several incarnations of a giant quarterback preparing to throw a football, a lowercase \"ny\", and stylized versions of the team nickname.\nGiants' jerseys are traditionally blue or red (or white with blue or red accents), and their pants alternate between white and gray. Currently, the Giants wear home jerseys that are solid blue with white block numbering, white pants with five thin blue/gray/red/gray/blue stripes on the pant legs, and solid blue socks. For this they gained their most renowned nickname, \"Big Blue\". For road uniforms, they wear a white jersey with red block numbering and red \"Northwestern\" stripes on the sleeves, gray pants with three thin non-contiguous red/blue/red stripes on the pant legs, and solid red socks. The Giants' current helmet is metallic blue with white block numbers, which are frontally mounted and base mounted on either side of a red stripe running down the center or frontally mounted and base mounted on the red center stripe itself. The Giants, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers, are one of only two teams in the NFL to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The helmet is adorned on both sides with the stylized white lower case \"ny\" logo and features a gray facemask. The home uniforms are generally similar to the design used from 1966 to 1974, but with some slight elements from the 1956\u20131961 uniforms. The road uniforms are essentially a modernization of the design used from 1956 to 1961. Additionally, the Giants had a third jersey until the 2009 season, which recalled the Giants' solid red home jerseys from the early 1950s: a solid red alternate with white block numbers. These jerseys were used a total of four times, but have since been retired. They were used once in 2004 against the Philadelphia Eagles and in three consecutive years \u2013 2005, 2006, and 2007 \u2013 against the Dallas Cowboys.\nOwnerships, financial history and fan base.\nThe Giants have had a long and, at times, turbulent financial history. The team was founded by Tim Mara with an investment of US$500 in 1925 and became one of the first teams in the then five-year-old NFL. To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name \"New York Football Giants\", which they still use as their legal corporate name.\nAlthough the Giants were successful on the field in their initial seasons, their financial status was a different story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. The Giants were in dire financial straits until the 11th game of the season when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered the history of the franchise. The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. Following the 1930 season, Mara transferred ownership of the team over to his two sons to insulate the team from creditors, and by 1946, he had given over complete control of the team to them. Jack, the older son, controlled the business aspects, while Wellington controlled the on-field operations. After their initial struggles the Giants financial status stabilized, and they led the league in attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s.\nBy the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league's biggest attractions. However, rather than continuing to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue for the benefit of the entire league. Revenue sharing is still practiced in the NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league. After their struggles in the latter half of the 1960s and the entire 1970s, the Giants hired an outsider, George Young, to run the football operations for the first time in franchise history. The Giants' on-field product and business aspects improved rapidly following the move.\nIn 1991, Tim Mara, grandson of the founder, was struggling with cancer and sold his half of the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, who had been with the team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died at the age of 89. His death was followed two weeks later by the death of Tisch. In 2015, Wellington's widow and Giants co-owner Ann died due to complications from a head injury suffered in a fall. She was 85 years old.\nIn 2010, MetLife Stadium opened, replacing Giants Stadium. The new stadium is a 50/50 partnership between the Giants and Jets, and while the stadium is owned by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority on paper, the two teams jointly built the stadium using private funds, and administer it jointly through New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation. The Giants had previously planned a $300 million renovation to the Meadowlands, before deciding in favor of the new stadium which was originally estimated to cost approximately $600 million, before rising to an estimated cost of one billion dollars. One advantage gained by owning the stadium is that the teams saved considerable money in tax payments. The teams leased the land from the state at a cost of $6.3 million per year. The state paid for all utilities, including the $30 million needed to install them.\nThe Giants are owned and operated by John Mara and Steve Tisch. \"Forbes\" magazine estimated the value of the team in 2012 to be $1.3 billion. This ranks the New York Giants as the fourth most valuable franchise in the NFL and the ninth most valuable professional sports franchise in the world. The value has steadily increased from $288 million in 1998, to their current value. The magazine estimated their revenue in 2006 at $182 million, of which $46 million came from gate receipts. Operating income was $26.9 million, and player salary was $102 million. Current major sponsors include Gatorade, Anheuser Busch, Toyota, and Verizon Wireless. Recent former sponsors include Miller Brewing and North Fork Bank. Luxury suites, retail and game day concessions at the new stadium are provisioned and operated by global hospitality giant Delaware North. The team's average ticket price is $72.\nThe Giants draw their fans from the New York metropolitan area. Since their move to New Jersey in 1976, fans from each state have claimed the team as their own. In January 1987, shortly before the team won Super Bowl XXI, then New York City mayor Ed Koch labeled the team \"foreigners\" and said they were not entitled to a ticker-tape parade in New York City. On February 5, 2008, the city, under mayor Michael Bloomberg, threw a ticker tape parade in honor of the Giants' Super Bowl XLII victory at the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan. New York City held another ticker tape parade on February 7, 2012, in honor of the Giants' Super Bowl XLVI victory. According to a team spokesman, in 2001, 52 percent of the Giants' season ticket-holders lived in New Jersey. Most of the remaining ticket holders lived in New York State with some coming from other states.\nThrough the lean years of the 1960s and 1970s the Giants, in spite of a 17-year-long playoff drought, still accumulated a 20-year-long waiting list for season tickets. It has been estimated that the Giants have a waiting list of 135,000 people, the largest of any North American professional sports franchise.\nRivalries.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nThe rivalry between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles is one of the oldest in the NFL, dating back to 1933. The two teams have frequently fought for playoff contention, NFC East titles, and respect. While the Giants have dominated this rivalry throughout most of its history, the series began to even after the 1980s, with the Eagles going 22\u201321 against New York through the 1990s and 2000s. Philadelphia then dominated New York in the 2010s with a 16\u20134 record to claim their first lead in the series. The Eagles lead the all-time series 90\u201388\u20132 as of the 2021 season. The two teams have met four times in the postseason, with each team winning two games. Three of those four playoff meetings were held in the 2000s decade. New York City and Philadelphia have a strong geographic rivalry, as seen in other professional sports such as the Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry in Major League Baseball, and the Flyers\u2013Rangers and Devils\u2013Flyers rivalries in the National Hockey League.\nWashington Commanders.\nThe Giants have an old and storied rivalry with Washington, dating back to 1932. While this rivalry is typically given less significance than the rivalries with the Eagles and Cowboys, there have been periods of great competition between the two. In the 1980s the Giants and Redskins, as they were then known, clashed as both struggled against each other for division titles and even Super Bowl Championships. Most notable among these is the 1986 NFC Championship game in which the Giants defeated the Redskins 17\u20130 to earn their first ever trip to the Super Bowl. Wellington Mara always felt this was the Giants oldest and truest rival, and after passing away in 2005, the Giants honored their longtime owner by defeating the Redskins 36\u20130 at home. The Giants lead this series 105\u201370\u20134 as of the 2021 season. The Giants 105 wins against the Washington Commanders are the most wins for one team against one opponent in NFL history.\nDallas Cowboys.\nThe Giants have maintained a fierce divisional rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys since the Cowboys first began play in 1960. The two teams have a combined nine Super Bowl victories between them, and have played many games in which the NFC East title was at stake. The rivalry is unique among professional sports as it is the only divisional rivalry between sports teams from New York City and Dallas, partially due to the large distance between the two cities. The Cowboys lead the regular season series 71\u201347\u20132, while the Giants hold the lone playoff victory between the two teams, held at the conclusion of the 2007 season.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nDespite never being in the same division, the Giants and 49ers have developed a heated rivalry over the years. The two teams have met eight times in the playoffs (including two NFC Championship Games, both won by New York) since 1982, which is the most of any two teams in that span. In the overall series, both the Giants and 49ers are tied 21\u201321, while the postseason series are also tied 4\u20134. Five of the eight times the Giants and 49ers have played in the postseason, the winner of their game has gone on to win the Super Bowl.\nChicago Bears.\nThe Giants and Bears squared off in six NFL championship games, more than any common matchup in either the NFL championship game or Super Bowl. Though the Bears won four of the six championship games, one of the Giants' two championship victories included the Sneakers Game that took place in the 1934 NFL Championship Game. The two teams also met in the 1985 and 1990 playoffs, splitting each meeting en route to a Super Bowl championship (Bears in Super Bowl XX, Giants in Super Bowl XXV). The Bears lead the all-time series 36\u201324\u20132, including a 5\u20133 postseason record.\nNew York Jets.\nThe Giants and Jets for many years had the only intracity rivalry in the NFL, made even more unusual by sharing a stadium. They have met annually in the preseason since 1969. Since 2011, this meeting has been known as the \"MetLife Bowl\", after the naming sponsor of the teams' stadium. Regular season matchups between the teams occur once every four years, as they follow the NFL scheduling formula for interconference games. Since the two teams play each other so infrequently in the regular season, some, including players on both teams, have questioned whether the Giants and Jets have a real rivalry. A memorable regular season game was in 1988, when the Giants faced off against the Jets in the last game of the season, needing a victory to make the playoffs. The Jets played spoiler, however, beating the Giants 27\u201321 and ruining the latter's playoff hopes. A different scenario unfolded during the penultimate regular season game of 2011 as the \"visiting\" Giants defeated the Jets 29\u201314. The victory simultaneously helped eliminate the Jets from playoff contention and propel the Giants to their own playoff run and eventual win in Super Bowl XLVI. The Giants lead the overall regular season series 8\u20136 and have won five of the last seven meetings.\nNew England Patriots.\nThe two teams rarely played each other given they were on opposite conferences, but the rivalry gained notoriety in the late 2000s thanks to some close contests and memorable moments between Tom Brady and Eli Manning. In the 2007 season, the Patriots defeated the Giants 38\u201335 to clinch a perfect 16\u20130 regular season, but could not finish a perfect 19\u20130 season in Super Bowl XLII following a 17\u201314 defeat. That game featured the now-iconic Helmet Catch from David Tyree. The Giants also defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, a 21\u201317 victory.\nPlayers.\nPro Football Hall of Famers.\nIn the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Giants boast the second-most enshrined members with 29. Tim Mara, Mel Hein, Pete Henry, Cal Hubbard and Jim Thorpe were a part of the original class of inductees in 1963, while defensive end Michael Strahan, the most recent Giant inducted, was a part of the Class of 2014. Numerous members, including Larry Csonka, Ray Flaherty, Joe Guyon, Pete Henry, Arnie Herber, Cal Hubbard, Tom Landry, Don Maynard, Hugh McElhenny, Jim Thorpe, and Kurt Warner were at one time associated with the New York Giants, but they were inducted largely based on their careers with other teams.\nRing of Honor.\nThe New York Giants unveiled their own Ring of Honor on October 3, 2010, during halftime of their . John Mara had long wished to create a Giants Ring of Honor and Hall of Fame to honor Giants who helped the franchise achieve each of their championships, and the building of MetLife Stadium resulted in the realization of that ambition. The organization had an inaugural induction class of 30 including players, coaches, owners and executives that have had a great impact on the organization. While the entire list of inductees was not revealed until the actual induction, the organization did confirm about a week before the ceremony that Phil Simms, Bill Parcells, Michael Strahan, Tiki Barber, Frank Gifford and Pete Gogolak would all be inducted.\nMedia, radio and television.\nAs of 2010, the Giants' flagship radio station is WFAN, with games simulcast on WFAN-FM as of November 2012. Since WFAN also has the rights to carry baseball, as they currently are the flagship station for the New York Yankees and previously served the same role for the New York Mets, early season Giants games come into conflict; since 2019, WFAN has split the coverage across both of its dial positions, with the Giants carried on 660 AM and the Yankees on 101.9 FM. Prior to that, the Giants\u2019 games would air on one of WFAN\u2019s designated overflow stations.\nBob Papa on play-by-play and Carl Banks on color commentary are the Giants' radio broadcast team, with Howard Cross as the sideline reporter. When Papa is unavailable to call games Chris Carrino, WFAN's lead broadcaster for the Brooklyn Nets, substitutes for him. Games are carried over the New York Giants Radio Network over various stations in New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.\nPreseason telecasts not seen nationally air in the area on WNBC, with WWOR-TV serving as an overflow station for when WNBC is airing other programming such as the Summer Olympic Games. Papa and Banks call these games on television, with studio host Paul Dottino as Papa's substitute. WPIX-TV or WABC-TV will also air any Giants broadcast that is carried by ESPN, as per the local carriage rules (WABC-TV corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company, holds an 80% majority ownership stake in ESPN, and has a right of first refusal for these telecasts). Thursday Night Football games exclusive to NFL Network are carried locally by the producing network's O&amp;O, which is WNYW. If the game is not simulcast on Fox, WNBC carries the game.\nThe Giants' public address announcer at MetLife Stadium is Jim Hall, who for years was Bob Sheppard's substitute at Yankee Stadium due to their very similar voices. Hall took over the Giants PA job after Sheppard elected to leave the position in 2005 to focus solely on his Yankee Stadium duties.\nPast.\nWFAN has produced the Giants' radio broadcasts since 1995, but has not always aired them on the station. For 1995, then-Giants flagship WOR continued to carry the games as they had for the previous two seasons. In 1996 the games were simulcast on WFAN and WOR, which caused some conflict as at the time, WFAN was the radio flagship of the New York Jets as well. To remedy the situation, beginning the next year WFAN moved the Giants' radio broadcasts to the FM dial and sister station WNEW-FM, where they remained until the end of the 1999 season. In 2000 WFAN lost the Jets' radio contract to WABC and the Giants moved back to WFAN where they have been ever since.\nThe Giants' longtime radio home was WNEW, where games aired from the mid-1950s until 1993 when the station was bought by Bloomberg L.P. and changed its format. Marty Glickman teamed with Al DeRogatis for a long stretch beginning in the early 1960s on WNEW. Chip Cipolla and later Sam Huff joined Glickman after DeRogatis left to join Curt Gowdy on NBC. After the WNEW split, games began airing on WOR. Glickman moved to the crosstown Jets in 1973 and was succeeded by Marv Albert. Jim Gordon succeeded Albert in 1977, beginning an 18-year tenure as the Giants' play-by-play voice. Meanwhile, Dick Lynch took over as color analyst in 1976 and continued in that role through 2007, with his last game being Super Bowl XLII, and retired following the season due to his advancing leukemia, which took his life in September 2008.\nEventually Gordon and Lynch were joined by Karl Nelson, a former lineman for the Giants. Gordon and Nelson were fired after the 1994 season, after which Papa took over the play-by-play (after being studio host) and led a two-man booth with Lynch. Dave Jennings joined the broadcast team in 2002 following his firing by the Jets, with whom he had worked since his 1987 retirement from the NFL. Jennings was moved to the pregame show after the 2006 season and was replaced by Carl Banks, leaving broadcasting altogether in 2008 due to his ongoing battle with Parkinson's disease that he lost in 2013.\nAfter WFAN began airing games Richard Neer served as pregame and postgame host. He was replaced by Sid Rosenberg, who was in turn fired by the station due to troubles and replaced by Chris Carlin. Carlin left in 2008 to focus full-time on his duties as SNY studio host and Rutgers athletics radio voice and was replaced by WWOR sports reporter and former WFAN host Russ Salzberg, who cohosted with Roman Oben after Jennings left. WEPN Giants beat reporter Paul Dottino was hired by WFAN to host the pregame show for 2009 and continues to be a part of the program. As of the 2020 season, Lance Medow is the host for the pregame show as well as halftime and postgame, with former Giants punter Jeff Feagles as analyst.\nThe Giants were carried on the DuMont Network, then CBS in the early TV days of the NFL, when home games were blacked out within a 75-mile radius of New York City. Chris Schenkel was their play-by-play announcer in that early era when each team was assigned its own network voice on its regional telecasts. At the time, there were few if any true national telecasts until the NFL championship game, which was carried by NBC. Schenkel was joined by Jim McKay, later Johnny Lujack through the 1950s and the early 1960s. As Giants players retired to the broadcast booth in the early and 1960s, first Pat Summerall, then Frank Gifford took the color analyst slot next to Schenkel. As the 1970 merger of the NFL and AFL approached, CBS moved to a more generic announcer approach and Schenkel was off the broadcasts.\nGiants regular season Sunday telecasts moved to Fox when that network took over NFC telecasts in 1994 and are carried locally by WNYW.\nWCBS-TV and WPIX were previously home to Giants preseason telecasts in the 1990s, with WPIX serving as the Giants' (and Jets') long-time preseason home. After the NFC rights were lost by CBS, the Giants followed the conference's broadcast rights to WNYW. WWOR became the Giants' flagship TV station in the late 1990s, and stayed so up until WNBC took over rights in 2005.\nWhen the Giants first moved to WNYW, Mike Breen was their preseason play-by-play man. Sam Rosen was the television voice for some time afterward, except for two years when Curt Menefee (then of WNYW) was the voice. When the games moved to WWOR, Rosen regained the position and held it until 2004. Former Giant receiver Phil McConkey became the early season analyst after his retirement and stayed in the booth for many years."}
